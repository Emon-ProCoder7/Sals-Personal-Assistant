The conversation begins with Sal introducing Angelie, the CMO of Pop Social, highlighting her speech in Vietnam that sparked thoughts about social media innovation with blockchain, Web3, and AI, and the potential for these platforms to provide more in terms of ownership, control, privacy, and rewards, contrasting this with traditional social media that often "milks" users' time, energy, and attention without significant return. It's argued that there has to be a better way than the current social media model, with the future demanding platforms that offer greater control and privileges, acknowledging the billions made by current platforms through ads run against user content and attention. Angelie expresses gratitude for being back to share what Pop Social is doing. She acknowledges the evolution of social media from texting to multimedia sharing and algorithm-driven engagement, but states that in 2025, with the advent of AI and Web3, users are demanding ownership, privacy, and control over their data and digital identities, and Pop Social is leading the way. She explains how Pop Social started as a decentralized social platform but is now evolving into a full-fledged Pop ecosystem. The key components of this ecosystem are introduced: Pop Social as the foundation of decentralized social networking, PopMax as the decentralized innovation fund acting as the fuel for everything being built, Punk Words which is bridging digital culture with real-world adoption and is expected to pave the way for NASDAQ listing, PopX an ecological fund built in collaboration with NX1 exchange to support Web3 and AI projects, and POP Chain which is the backbone connecting everything together. Angelie personally shares that what impressed her about Pop Social was how it's giving ownership to the people, having felt the "pain" of centralized social media where users contribute hours and content but receive nothing of the billions in profit generated. She contrasts this with the hours Sal spends on social media, where he creates "not much" value other than business posts, often engaging in "doom scrolling". Pop Social is described as a Web3 and AI-powered platform with decentralized social infrastructure that integrates AI-driven innovation, data privacy, and token incentives. The vision or mission is simple yet powerful: giving ownership to users over their data and content, encouraging content creation through direct rewards, and building a decentralized, long-term ecosystem. Key features include decentralized identity management, functioning like a personal website that cannot be taken down, where content is stored in Web3 infrastructure, making it truly yours and safe. AI-driven digital innovation is a feature to help users create content, saving time and boosting creativity by enabling imagination and exploration, and it will curate a feed based on user liking and interest, addressing issues seen on traditional platforms where users are shown unwanted or irrelevant content. An efficient token economy is highlighted, where, unlike traditional social media, where only content posters earn value, with Pop Social, even activities like liking, commenting, or sharing, which are done daily, will earn rewards through the PPD token, which is already listed on many big exchanges. User data privacy protection ensures data is completely safe and belongs to the user, who gets to choose whether to share it and can even earn rewards for doing so, presenting a "win-win" scenario. Angelie summarizes Pop Social as being fundamentally about empowerment, giving users control over their data, digital identity, and rewards. She emphasizes it is not just another Web3 project but a well-planned, well-funded movement with the right team. The platform is backed by top-tier investment institutions like Fundamental Labs, S Ventures, and Chainlink. The PPD token is listed on leading exchanges including Bybit, Bitget, MEXC Global, Gate.io, BingX, and NX1. Angelie expresses pride in the Pop Social team, calling it a powerhouse. The CEO and co-founder, Michael Shen, has eight years of blockchain experience and is dedicated to bridging traditional social media with decentralized platforms. The CPO, Dr. Jeff Jo, has a PhD from MIT and a background at Apple. The team comprises top professionals from North America, specialized in blockchain, AI, and decentralized identity management. The Pop Social 2.0 strategy signifies a huge shift from a decentralized social platform to a full-fledged Pop ecosystem, where users will be building, trading, and earning, not just creating content or connecting. This strategy involves integrating more projects to increase PPD token use cases and enhancing the economic model for long-term value. The transition will occur in two major phases. Phase One (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025), already underway, focuses on community expansion (building a stronger, engaged, and empowered community), integrating new projects, enhancing the economic model (including dedicating 70% of the total supply to reward users), and achieving a $1 billion market cap. Angelie acknowledges the $1 billion target sounds ambitious but is part of a well-planned, strategic roadmap. PopMax is central to fueling this growth, ensuring PPD is active (working, circulating, rewarding, and helping build new projects) and has true value, aiming for sustainability over quick pumps. Pop Social has already surpassed 500,000 users, and the market value has doubled from $20 million to $40 million, seen as just the beginning of achievements. PopMax will continue to empower PPD through additional staking and investment opportunities. Phase Two (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2026) is the planning phase, focusing on launching the POP Chain mainnet (designed for speed, scalability, seamless integration, and is AI-driven for global markets, with a potential user base of 5 million), the listing of the Pop ecosystem on US Nasdaq, and reaching a $3 to $5 billion market cap. The move to Nasdaq is seen as going beyond crypto to play in the "big league," where traditional finance holds significant capital (Nasdaq market cap is much larger than the global Web3 market cap), aiming for real adoption, real capital, and real influence. This move is not just about listing but creating a blueprint for blockchain businesses and setting a stage for Wall Street and Web3 to move forward together. The tokenomics model has a total supply of 200 million tokens, with 70% allocated for content creation incentives. Other allocations include 4% for the team/advisors (locked for two years, gradually unlocked), 10% for notes/liquidity incentive, 5% for seed/strategic financing, 2% for marketing, 3% for community results, and 6% for early institutional investment. Four reasons are given for why the PPD price will inevitably rise: a token burn mechanism (10% burned during NFT synthesis, up to 100 million tokens), diverse staking opportunities that reduce circulating supply, extensive use cases across the growing Pop ecosystem, and market recognition in the hot AI+social sector. The roadmap outlines 2023 as the foundation year (funding received, PPD issued and listed), 2024 as the growth phase (partnership with PopMax Foundation, community expansion, NFT staking launched), 2025 as the breakout year (Pop Social 2.0 launch, Punk Words/POPEX/PopChain testnet going live, $1 billion market cap target), and 2026 as the year to "go next level" (PopChain mainnet live, 200+ projects deployed, Pop Social 2.0 completion, US Nasdaq listing, $3-$5 billion market cap target). The speaker encourages listeners to be part of the Pop ecosystem to build something memorable, emphasizing it's time to move beyond being victims of centralized social media. Sal reflects that the ecosystem's bigger picture is even more exciting than the compensation plan, showing the potential of combining Web3 with Wall Street innovation. He notes the early stage of the project, with NFT staking having started recently, and is gaining a deeper understanding of the "grand" potential from the many parts of the ecosystem. The token burn mechanism (10% burn during staking, going into a black hole wallet) and staking locking up tokens will continue to reduce the circulating supply while demand increases through partnerships and growing understanding. The potential upside is incredible, with the PPD asset itself offering value, having already gone from 8 cents to over 20 cents in its "premature state". Market caps of over a billion are seen as "not that crazy" given the potential, referencing examples like Bored Ape Yacht Club and the Pop ecosystem's online/offline presence through Punk Words. The upcoming launch of the Pop Social platform is anticipated to allow people to explore features not offered by traditional platforms, especially appealing to those already familiar with crypto/blockchain. Sal is rediscovering and gaining a deeper understanding, finding the project is getting "better and better," which he notes is rare. He sees an opportunity for anyone doing something online to participate in the Pop ecosystem, whether through staking or social media engagement, highlighting the utility of PPD beyond just earning and staking. The project is seen as having true practicality, not just theoretical potential, and is doing "big things" rather than just talking. It is noted that Pop Social is predominantly taking off in Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, China, and South Korea, leaving many other markets open for growth. The user-friendly nature of the platform is highlighted as a key factor for well-positioned growth in the direction of AI, Web3, and social finance. Angelie concludes by comparing the current opportunity to the early days of TikTok, where those who took it seriously became very rich, urging people to choose whether to trust the process and go to the next level with Pop Social or regret missing out later. Sal echoes this, mentioning missed opportunities with early Instagram and now facing high competition. He believes this new era, infusing blockchain, crypto, social media, and Wall Street innovations, is worth the chance due to its uniqueness and already "sufficiently amazing" state with earnings and listings. The potential is described as astronomical. The presence being created through sponsoring events and participating in panels is mentioned, anticipating further growth when the social media part goes live and incentivizes influencers. This is presented as an opportunity to be at the right place at the right time, both economically and financially, and to take off on social media and become an authority figure.
4) 4)The Gifting Tribe Pop Max | CMO Anjali's Speech @ Vietnam Event
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC6zubP9ufQ)
The speaker begins by introducing Pop Social, describing it as the foundation of decentralized social networking. They mention a project called "built word" (likely Punk Words as mentioned later in a different source) that is connecting both digital collectibles and culture to real-world adoption and is expected to pave the way for a Nasdaq listing. The speaker highlights the significant market cap of Nasdaq, stated as $34.54 trillion, which is 12.7 times larger than the Web3 market cap.
The focus shifts to Pop Social version 2.0, described as being about energy, innovation, and community. Social media has evolved from messaging to multimedia sharing and algorithmic engagement, but in 2025, with the advent of AI and Web3, users are demanding ownership, control over their digital identities and content, and Pop Social is leading the way. Pop Social, which started as a centralized social platform, is now converting into a full-fledged ecosystem, a network of projects designed to bring value, innovation, financial growth, and real-world adoption.
The key components of this Pop ecosystem are introduced:
â€¢	Pop Social: The foundation of decentralized social networking.
â€¢	PopMax: A decentralized innovation fund that fuels everything being built in the ecosystem, acting like the "machine engine". PopMax ensures that PPD has value, is working for the user, rewarding, circulating, and supporting new projects. It helps ensure long-term value growth for PPD, not just sudden pumps. PopMax will continue to empower PPD through additional staking and investment opportunities.
â€¢	Punk Words (referred to as "built word"): Connects digital collectibles and culture to real-world adoption and is expected to pave the way for the Nasdaq listing. It is a bridge connecting Web2 and Web3, described as a trend-setting ecosystem combining physical collectibles, NFTs, and gamified digital finance. The main goal is to take it to Nasdaq so that PPD is accessible to Web2 traditional investors, bridging Web2 and Web3.
â€¢	PopX: An ecological fund launched in collaboration with NX1, which will empower and support Web3 and AI projects. Projects on PopX will use PPD, increasing its utilities and demand. All profits from PopX will be used to buy back and burn PPD. Projects will be deployed on the upcoming blockchain.
â€¢	POP Chain: The backbone connecting everything together, a public chain designed for speed, scalability, and seamless integration. It is an AI-driven blockchain solution built for the global market with features like rich traffic expansion to various regions (South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, China, India, Africa), a complete economic model (multiple DEXs, meme launchpads, lending tools), multiple application scenarios for both Web3 and Web2 users, and a user base of 5 million. More projects will be implemented and integrated with PPD, increasing use cases and demand.
The speaker shares that what impressed her most about Pop Social when she joined was its mission. She felt the pain of centralized social media, where users spend hours but earn nothing, while these platforms take all the profit from ads shown against user content and attention.
Pop Social's mission is simple yet impactful:
1.	Giving users ownership of their data because it belongs to them.
2.	Encouraging content creation through direct rewards.
3.	Building a decentralized and sustainable economy. Traditional platforms are empty boxes without users who are the value drivers, bringing audience and content.
Pop Social has four key features:
1.	Decentralized Identity Management: Acts like a user's own website that nobody can ban or take down. The identity and content are stored on Web3 infrastructure, giving the user control.
2.	AI-Driven Digital Innovation: AI helps users create content ("AIGC"), saving time, supporting imagination, reimagination, and creativity. AI also helps curate a personalized feed based on user interest and liking.
3.	Efficient Token Economy: On traditional social media, users who just engage by watching, liking, commenting, or sharing earn no value. On Pop Social, even engaging activities have value, and users are rewarded for being part of the growth story.
4.	User Data Privacy Protection: User data is stored on Web3 infrastructure, making it completely safe and belonging to the user, not any central authority.
Pop Social is described as not just another Web3 project but a well-funded and fast-growing movement with the right team and partners. It has received $4 million in funding from top-tier institutions: Fundamental Labs, S Ventures, and Chainlink. The PPD token used for rewarding users is already listed on well-known exchanges: Bybit, Bitget, MEXC Global, Gate.io, BingX, and NX1. Pop Social also has support from Binance and OKX.
The team is considered a "powerhouse" with top professionals from North America specializing in Web3, AI, and decentralized identities. Michael Shen is the CEO and co-founder with eight years of industry experience, dedicated to bridging traditional social media to decentralized platforms. Dr. Jeff Jo (referred to as Dr. Chu) is the CPO with a PhD from MIT and extensive experience in product design and innovation.
The big strategy involves Pop Social transforming into a full-fledged ecosystem, becoming an economy where users are building, earning, and trading. This transition will occur in two phases.
Phase One: Already started from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.
â€¢	Attracting new projects and members, focusing on community expansion (building a stronger, empowered, and engaged community).
â€¢	Integrating new projects to increase PPD utilities and demand.
â€¢	Enhancing the economic model, dedicating 70% of the total supply for rewarding users.
â€¢	Achieving a $1 billion market cap goal. This sounds ambitious but is part of a well-planned roadmap.
Achievements are already being seen: surpassing 500,000 users and doubling the market cap from $20 million to $40 million.
Phase Two: Starts on January 1, 2026, and ends by December 21, 2026.
â€¢	Launching the POP Chain public chain mainnet.
â€¢	Listing the Pop ecosystem on the US Nasdaq. This is seen as going beyond crypto to play in the "big leagues," where big money is. It's about creating a dual-stock token model as a blueprint for blockchain businesses and setting the stage for Wall Street and Web3 to move together.
â€¢	Reaching a market cap of $3 to $5 billion.
The tokenomics model has a total supply of 200 million tokens.
â€¢	70% for content creation incentives.
â€¢	4% for team and advisors (locked).
â€¢	10% for notes and liquidity incentive.
â€¢	5% for seed and strategic financing.
â€¢	2% for marketing and advertising.
â€¢	3% for community results.
â€¢	6% for early institutional investments.
Four reasons are given for why the PPD price will definitely rise:
1.	Token burn mechanism: 10% of PPD is burned during NFT synthesis using PPD and USDT, reducing the total supply to a maximum of 100 million tokens. Less supply with high demand leads to a price increase.
2.	Diverse staking opportunities: PPD offers faster ways to earn through staking, giving users a reason to hold, which reduces the circulating supply.
3.	Extensive use cases: PPD is integrated into multiple projects like Punk Words, the blockchain, PopX, and other incubated projects, increasing utility and demand.
4.	Market recognition: PPD is positioned in the hot AI+social sector, attracting more investors and buyers, increasing demand and credibility.
The roadmap outlines the history and future:
â€¢	2023: Foundation year (Funding secured, PPD issued and listed on exchanges like Bitget, Bybit, Gate.io, NX, and NX1).
â€¢	2024: Growth year (Partnership with PopMax for global promotion, community expansion, NFT staking functionality started for PPD).
â€¢	2025: Breakout year (Pop Social 2.0 strategy launch, PopMax introduces PPD financial scenarios, Punk Words and PopX go live soon, Pop Foundation established, Blockchain testnet goes live, $1 billion market cap target).
â€¢	2026: Go to the next level (Blockchain mainnet live, over 200 projects deployed on Pop Chain, Pop Social 2.0 strategy completion, Pop ecosystem listed on Nasdaq, $3 to $5 billion market cap target).
The speaker concludes by urging listeners to build something memorable with Pop Social, as the future is here, and it's time to stop being victims of centralized social media.


POP MAX COMP PLAN
1.	Pop Max | $1,000 To $10,000 Per Daily Possible??
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkrHu1JV_zA
Introduction to Pop Social and Pop Max
Pop Social is described as a pioneer in the Web3 and social finance space. The newest addition to the Pop Social ecosystem, called Pop Max, launched about two months ago, around the Chinese New Year. Pop Max's objective is to support the ecosystem projects, promote user participation, and drive ecosystem growth, specifically by optimizing the circulation of the Pop Social token.
Pop Social Platform
â€¢	Mission: To become an AI-driven reward-based Web3 version of Tik Tok and Telegram.
â€¢	Status: The beta version of the app launched in January 2024, and the project has been running for over a year. It currently has over 500,000 registered users and a market value over $40 million. The team looks forward to reaching over 1 million members, which is expected to cause the valuation to take a big leap up.
â€¢	User Rewards: Users can earn rewards by creating content, inviting friends, liking, sharing posts, etc.. Rewards are received in the native token called PPT (Pop Social Token). PPT can be spent, staked, withdrawn, and sold.
Pop Social Token (PPT)
â€¢	Total Supply: There are 200 million tokens, which is seen as a low number compared to projects with billions.
â€¢	Deflationary Mechanism: The token supply will be reduced down to 100 million tokens through a deflationary mechanism. This is expected to increase the chance of reaching a higher value. 10% of the PPT used for staking is burned, contributing to this deflation.
â€¢	Distribution: 70% of the token supply is used for creating incentives for content within the app.
â€¢	Audit: The PPT token has a Certik score of 79.97, which is considered a very high rate (an A rate). You can look this up on Skynet by Certik.
â€¢	Exchange Listings: The token is fully listed on CoinMarketCap. It is already listed on five different exchanges: Bybit (ranked number two after Binance), Bitget, Mexi, Gate.io, and BingX. These are described as top global exchanges.
â€¢	Future Listings: There are targets for future listings on OKX and Binance. It is mentioned that two of the founders are former executives from both Binance and OKX, suggesting a fast track for listing on these platforms.
Pop Max Staking Feature
â€¢	Mechanism: Pop Max offers a multiple staking contract with a revolutionary option.
â€¢	Staking Assets: To stake, you can use 50% PPT and 50% USDT, or you can stake 100% USDT. If you stake 100% USDT, the system will internally convert 50% of the USDT to PPT for the staking.
â€¢	Staking Periods & Rates: You can choose staking periods of 10, 30, 90, 180, or 360 days. The 180 and 360-day options recently launched. The potential rate is 1% per day for the 360-day period, which is described as very attractive.
â€¢	Synthetic NFT: When you stake, the system creates a synthetic NFT that represents your staking, including the duration and daily rate.
Earning Mechanics (Daily Yield, PUSD, Yield Pool)
â€¢	Daily Yield: Your daily staking reward (yield) ends up in a pool called the PUSD pool.
â€¢	PUSD: PUSD is an internal stable coin connected to USDT. It acts as a settlement token within the app and has no life outside of it.
â€¢	Yield Pool Bonus: By keeping your funds in the PUSD pool, you receive something called a yield pool bonus, which acts like a compounding effect or interest on the interest. Daily rates for this bonus have been seen between 0.65% and 1.3%, with an average around 0.975%.
â€¢	Yield Pool Source: The yield pool is funded by a 10% withdrawal fee on all funds when people make withdrawals from the PUSD pool. This fee does not go to the company.
â€¢	Yield Pool Distribution: The 10% withdrawal fee is distributed back to the members: 50% goes to everyone who keeps funds in the PUSD pool (the yield pool bonus), 40% goes to node holders, and 10% goes to an education fund.
â€¢	Withdrawal Process: To withdraw funds earned as daily yield or team earnings, it starts in the PUSD pool. A 10% withdrawal fee is applied when moving from the PUSD pool to your balance. The remaining amount is still PUSD. From your balance, you swap PUSD to PPT. Then, you can withdraw PPT straight to your wallet and liquidate it to USDT on one of the listed exchanges.
â€¢	Principal Withdrawal: Your initial staked principal is returned to you after the staking period without the 10% withdrawal fee.
How the Money is Generated
â€¢	Liquidity Pool: The funds that users stake are transferred to a company's liquidity pool.
â€¢	Professional Trading Team: There is a professional trading team that executes trades, such as arbitrage trades, with the funds in the liquidity pool to generate more money.
â€¢	Comparison to Banks: This model of using pooled funds for trading to generate returns is compared to how banks operate and make billions in profit.
â€¢	PPT Burn: As mentioned, 10% of the PPT used in staking is burned, reducing the total supply.
Earning Through Referrals and Team Building
Beyond staking yield, you can earn through inviting others.
â€¢	Direct Referral Earnings: You receive 15% of the staking rewards of each person you personally refer. This is a separate bonus paid daily based on their daily rewards.
â€¢	Team Earnings: This is a matching bonus system with a breakaway structure. 
o	To qualify for team earnings, you need three personal referrals and a total staking volume of $30,000 across your team. This qualifies you as a P1 rank and opens up 10% earnings on the staking rewards of everyone in your team.
o	To reach P2, you need two P1 members in two separate team legs. You then receive 19% on your entire team's rewards.
o	Breakaway: If someone in your team reaches the P1 rank, they "break you off" by taking their 10%. You still earn the difference, which is 9% (19% - 10%) from their team volume below them.
o	Open Line: On any team legs where no one has reached the P1 rank, you continue to earn the full 19%. You can start multiple legs (fourth, fifth, etc.) to build more open line volume.
â€¢	Other Earnings: Other mentioned earning types include pool bonus, global bonus, mint earnings, dynamic earnings, and passive earnings.
â€¢	Income Potential: Examples are given showing potential daily earnings increasing significantly with team staking volume and rank, ranging from tens to thousands of dollars per day. For example, a P4 with $1 million in open line staking volume could earn roughly $3,700 per day.
Team, Backing, and Partners
â€¢	Team: Key team members include Co-founder and CEO Michael Shen (8 years experience in blockchain/crypto), Co-founder and CPO Dr. Joey Sho, Head of Engineering Amal Roi, advisors Fisal and John, and Product Lead Gonzalo Vincente. There is a larger team of over 30 core people plus IT staff globally.
â€¢	Institutional Investors: In October 2023, Pop Social had a strategic seed round financing over $4 million from multiple well-known institutions. A few listed are Fundamental Labs, Sara's Ventures, Prism Group, Fusion Labs, and Promatrix. Fundamental Labs is noted as a former investor in Coinbase and Binance. These investors are part of the Pop Social board, making decisions.
â€¢	Partners & Accelerators: Partners and accelerators include BNB Chain, OKX, Polygon, Consensus, Chain Link, and Cointelegraph, among others. More information is available on popsocial.io.
Why It's Seen as an Opportunity
The project is highlighted as having significant potential for several reasons:
â€¢	Proof of Concept: The Pop Social app is live with a substantial user base and market value.
â€¢	Institutional Backing: Significant funding and involvement from reputable investors.
â€¢	Exchange Listings: Already listed on major global exchanges.
â€¢	Experienced Team: Founders have high-level experience, including from top exchanges.
â€¢	Deflationary Tokenomics: The limited and decreasing token supply is seen as favorable for value.
â€¢	Timing: The English-speaking market is described as being "sleeping on" this opportunity, which is viewed as an advantage and responsibility for those getting involved now.
â€¢	Substance: Unlike projects without much substance, Pop Social has a real product (the social media app) and a comprehensive ecosystem. This makes it appealing not just to stakers but to general social media users.
The potential to earn significant daily income ($100 to $10,000 per day) is emphasized as possible with the compensation plan. The current timing is seen as crucial for market capture and growth.

â€¢	With a recent update, there is now an option to stake 100% USDT BEP-20.
â€¢	Staking creates a synthetic NFT that serves as a receipt coding the staking period and daily yield received.
â€¢	There are different staking periods with corresponding daily earnings percentages: 
o	10 days: 0.4% per day
o	30 days: 0.5% per day
o	90 days: 0.6% per day
o	180 days: 0.8% per day
o	360 days: 1% per day
â€¢	Staking rewards go into the PUSD pool.
The PUSD Pool and Yield Pool Distribution:
â€¢	PUSD is the company's internal stable coin, where 1 PUSD equals 1 USDT.
â€¢	Both passive staking rewards and any team earnings accumulate in the PUSD pool.
â€¢	Users can withdraw funds from the PUSD pool immediately if desired, even multiple times a day.
â€¢	If funds are left in the PUSD pool, users receive additional profits on their earnings.
â€¢	Holding funds in the PUSD pool allows participation in a daily yield pool bonus.
â€¢	This pool acts as a compounding effect. The more funds in the pool, the more received from the daily distribution.
â€¢	The Yield Pool Distribution mechanism is funded by a 10% withdrawal fee on profits (not principal).
â€¢	The funds from the 10% withdrawal fee are distributed as follows: 
o	50% goes to everyone who has PUSD in the pool.
o	40% goes to node holders.
o	10% goes to the expansion fund.
â€¢	The yield pool percentage can vary daily based on withdrawal amounts. Average examples seen range from 0.65% to 1.3% per day. An example calculation uses an average of 0.975% per day.
â€¢	Examples of daily yield from the PUSD pool are provided: 
o	$500 in PUSD pool: ~$4.8 daily yield (at 0.975%).
o	$2,000 in PUSD pool: ~$19.5 daily yield (at 0.975%).
o	$30,000 in PUSD pool: ~$292.50 daily yield (at 0.975%).
Earning Opportunities Beyond Staking:
â€¢	Users can earn by referring others and becoming an ambassador.
â€¢	For direct referrals, you earn a 15% daily match on your teammates' daily staking earnings. This payment is timestamped based on when the teammate started staking and occurs around the clock as teammates join in different time zones.
â€¢	Example direct referral earnings based on teammate staking: 
o	Teammate stakes $1,000 for 360 days (earns $10/day): You earn $1.50/day (15%).
o	Teammate stakes $500 for 180 days (earns $4/day): You earn $0.60/day (15%).
o	Teammate stakes $5,000 for 360 days (earns $50/day): You earn $7.50/day (15%).
â€¢	Users can also earn on their whole team (referrals of referrals) based on P1 to P9 ranks.
â€¢	To reach P1 rank, you need: 
o	Refer a minimum of three people directly.
o	Have $100 staked yourself.
o	Have a total team staking volume of $30,000.
â€¢	Once P1, you earn 10% on the entire team's daily staking rewards.
â€¢	To reach P2 rank, you need two teammates on two separate teams to become P1.
â€¢	From P2 onwards, the team earnings are based on an infinity unit breakaway plan and differential percentages. For instance, as a P2, you get 19% on open lines, but a 9% difference on legs where a teammate is P1. This continues down to the lowest person on the team until another ranked teammate breaks off.
â€¢	The highest rank shown is P9.
â€¢	For direct teammates, you can potentially earn both the 15% direct match and your rank percentage. As a P1, this would be 15% + 10% = 25% daily match on direct teammates' profits.
â€¢	Examples of potential team earnings based on volume and rank are provided, though calculated based on 'open lines' for simplicity: 
o	P4 level, team staking volume $50,000 (earning $500/day collectively): You match 37% = ~$185/day.
o	P4 level, team staking volume $250,000 (earning $2,500/day collectively): You match 37% = ~$925/day.
o	P4 level, team staking volume $1,000,000 (earning $10,000/day collectively): You match 37% = ~$3,700/day.
â€¢	Other bonus types mentioned include referral earnings pool bonus, global bonus, mint earnings, team earnings, dynamic earnings, and passive earnings.
How the System is Funded/Sustainable:
â€¢	The question "How do they make money to pay us?" is addressed.
â€¢	When staking PPT, 10% of the PPT is burned by going to a black hole wallet. This contributes to the deflationary mechanism, reducing the total supply.
â€¢	The company holds staked funds in a liquidity pool.
â€¢	They have a team of professional traders who use this liquidity pool to generate more funds by buying and selling PPT in the open markets.
â€¢	This trading activity is described as how they can pay out the daily yield, likened to how banks use deposited funds.
Withdrawing Earnings and Principal:
â€¢	All earnings go to the PUSD pool.
â€¢	Withdrawals from the PUSD pool go through the yield pool and incur a 10% withdrawal fee. This fee is only on profits and team earnings, not the principal staking amount.
â€¢	To withdraw, users swap PUSD (the internal stable coin) to PPT (the native token).
â€¢	The withdrawal process to the user's wallet is described as automatically processed under 1 minute.
â€¢	Users can hold the withdrawn PPT for possible price appreciation or sell it immediately on listed exchanges for other crypto like USDT.
â€¢	After the staking period ends, the principal can be unlocked and withdrawn without the 10% fee. This principal withdrawal is 100% to the wallet with zero fees.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSrqiqfz9fE
1. Staking and Reward Model
â€¢	To stake, you can use PPT and USDT. Previously it was 50/50, but now you can stake with 100% USDT, and the platform will automatically convert 50% to PPT for you.
â€¢	There are different staking periods available: 10, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days. The speaker notes that 180 and 360 days offer better percentages.
â€¢	With the 360-day staking period, you receive 1% daily staking yield.
â€¢	Daily staking rewards are paid into your PUSD pool. Every user has their own PUSD pool in the DApp/back office.
â€¢	PUSD is an internal stable token, where 1 PUSD equals 1 USDT. The reason for using PUSD is to avoid gas fees for internal transactions within the back office.
2. Yield Pool Bonus and Compounding
â€¢	If you keep your funds in the PUSD pool, you receive a yield pool bonus.
â€¢	This yield pool distribution system acts as a compounding effect. You earn additional interest on the funds held in your PUSD pool.
â€¢	The yield pool bonus comes from a 10% withdrawal fee charged when users withdraw funds from their PUSD pool.
â€¢	This 10% withdrawal fee is distributed as follows: 50% goes back to all PUSD pool holders, 40% goes to node holders, and 10% goes to education funds.
â€¢	The yield pool percentage can vary daily, depending on how many people are withdrawing from the pool. It has been observed ranging from 0.65% up to 1.3% per day. More withdrawals can potentially lead to a higher percentage.
â€¢	Yield pool calculations are estimates due to the variance based on withdrawal activity.
â€¢	Utilizing the yield pool compounding effect by keeping funds in the PUSD pool can potentially allow you to earn back your principal amount faster, estimated around 65 to 70 days, even with a 360-day staking lock.
3. Withdrawals
â€¢	Your principal staking amount cannot be withdrawn until the staking period ends (e.g., after 360 days). When the staking period ends, the principal can be withdrawn without a fee.
â€¢	However, the daily staking rewards received in the PUSD pool can be withdrawn at any time.
â€¢	The withdrawal process for rewards involves a 10% withdrawal fee from the PUSD pool.
â€¢	After the fee, the funds go to your balance (still in PUSD).
â€¢	From your balance, you use a swap function to swap PUSD to PPT. The exchange rate for PPT is shown in the DApp at the moment of the swap.
â€¢	From PPT, you can withdraw directly to your external wallet.
â€¢	PPT can then be held or sent to exchanges (like Bybit, Gate.io) to be exchanged for other currencies like USDT.
â€¢	The entire withdrawal process is described as very quick, taking only a matter of minutes.
â€¢	A new Over-The-Counter (OTC) option has been introduced in the DApp, allowing users to buy or sell PPT using USDT directly, which may be helpful in regions where exchange access is difficult.
4. Income Plan
â€¢	There are two main payout types: Direct Referral Earnings and Team Earnings.
â€¢	Direct Referral Earnings (also called Referral Earnings in the app): You earn 15% on the daily staking rewards of your personally sponsored members. This is a daily payout, not a one-time fee on their staked principal. Example: If a direct referral stakes $1000, they earn $10/day. You earn 15% of that, which is $1.50/day.
â€¢	Team Earnings (also called Dynamic Earnings in the app): You can earn a percentage (from 10% up to 82%) of the daily rewards earned by your entire team. To qualify for Team Earnings, you must reach the rank of P1. 
o	P1 Rank Requirements: Minimum $100 personal staking, minimum 3 personal referrals (each with $100+ staking), and $30,000 total team staking volume. Achieving P1 unlocks 10% team earnings.
o	Additional Earnings on Direct Referrals: If you qualify for Team Earnings, you earn both the 15% Direct Referral Earnings and your qualified Team Earnings percentage on your direct referrals' daily rewards. For a P1, this is 15% + 10% = 25% on direct referrals.
o	Ranking Up (e.g., P2): Requires specific achievements, such as having P1 members in separate team legs.
o	Rank Percentages: Your team earning percentage increases with your rank (e.g., P2: 19%, P4: 37%, P9: 82%).
o	Breakaway and Difference: When a member in your downline achieves a rank (e.g., P1), they "break you off" from their percentage. You then earn the difference between your rank percentage and their rank percentage on the volume below their rank. Example: A P2 (19%) with a P1 (10%) downline earns 19% on team volume in "open lines" (where there's no breakaway) and 19% - 10% = 9% on the team volume below that P1. On direct referrals in open lines, a P2 earns 15% + 19% = 34%.
o	Earnings examples based on open line staking volume and rank percentage are provided. The speaker notes that even at the highest rank (P9), earning 82% + 15% = 97% on daily earnings is sustainable because it's based on the rewards, not the principal.
5. Other Earnings Explained
â€¢	The back office lists various income types which can be confusing, but the speaker clarifies them.
â€¢	Referral Earnings: This is the 15% you earn on the daily rewards of your personally sponsored members.
â€¢	Pool Bonus: This is the additional earning received from the yield pool distribution when you keep funds in your PUSD pool.
â€¢	Global Bonus: A bonus for reaching the highest rank (P9), where you share 1% of the company's total daily reward payouts with other P9 members. No one has reached this rank yet.
â€¢	Mint Earnings: This is a general heading in the back office; the actual earnings listed under it are your Passive Earnings, which are your own daily staking rewards.
â€¢	Team Earnings: This is a general heading; the actual earnings listed under it are your Dynamic Earnings, which are the earnings received from your team's daily rewards based on your rank and the team structure.
6. DApp/Back Office Overview
â€¢	The DApp (decentralized application) runs on the blockchain.
â€¢	Access requires connecting your wallet.
â€¢	Key sections include: 
o	Home: General information, announcements.
o	Team: View your rank, personal referrals count, personal staking volume, referral link, total team members, and total team volume.
o	Staking: Where you initiate new staking contracts. You input amounts (USDT or PUSD), choose staking duration, and can use the automatic proportioning feature for USDT-only staking. A staking example tool is also available.
o	Income: Overview of your earnings. You can see your daily earning (which accumulates throughout the day), your total earnings (since you started), and your PUSD pool balance. All earnings eventually accumulate in the PUSD pool.
o	Asset: Where funds are moved to from the PUSD pool when you wish to withdraw or swap. Here you can swap PUSD to PPT and withdraw PPT to your wallet. This section also now includes Deposit and OTC options. The Asset section can hold PPT, PUSD, and USDT.
The speaker also mentioned upcoming events, specifically a global convention in Korea, noting high demand and limited space, and the possibility of a future event in Dubai. They also highlighted community communication channels like Telegram and WhatsApp for updates and information.
1.	Pop Max | $676 Per Day Comp Plan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltQWZAgAkVI&t=680s&pp=0gcJCbAJAYcqIYzv
The Pop Max platform offers users the opportunity to earn passive daily staking rewards, which can start for as little as $100 staked for a minimum of 10 days up to 360 days. Daily earnings can range from 0.4% to 1%. These earnings can be withdrawn instantly, typically within a minute, and the principal amount is returned at the end of the staking period. The PPT token, used by the platform, is listed on three of the top 10 exchanges globally, adding credibility.
Beyond the staking rewards, there is a completely optional but powerful check match referral program. This program pays users not just when their teammates make a deposit, but every time their teammates earn passively, the referrer also earns passively. This results in a continuous, steady growth in earnings rather than intermittent large payouts. The earnings from this program are a daily match on your team's daily profits.
The referral program has different ranks that users can achieve, which unlock higher matching percentages and deeper levels of earnings within their team structure. When starting out, everyone begins with no rank.
Here are the ranks and their qualifications and benefits described in the sources:
â€¢	No Rank: 
o	Requirements: None.
o	Benefits: 15% daily profit match on your direct referrals only. Earnings on level two and below do not count.
â€¢	P1: 
o	Requirements: 
ï‚§	Stake at least $100 yourself.
ï‚§	Have three direct signups who are funded (can be as little as $100 each).
ï‚§	Accumulate $30,000 in total team volume. This volume can come from your directs, their referrals, and everyone below them, regardless of depth or direct relationship.
o	Benefits: P1 is described as the foundational unit for all other ranks. Achieving P1 does two main things: 
ï‚§	Adds 10% to your direct match, making it 25% (15% + 10%) daily profit match on your directs.
ï‚§	Unlocks a 10% daily profit match on all volume on level two and below within your team organization, until you encounter another P1 rank or higher in a specific leg. Reaching P1 can significantly increase daily earnings compared to being just under the qualification.
â€¢	P2: 
o	Requirements: 
ï‚§	Stake at least $200 yourself.
ï‚§	Have two separate teams where someone has reached the P1 rank. These P1s do not need to be direct to you, just located in two different legs of your team structure.
o	Benefits: Your matching percentage on level two and below increases to 19%. (If a direct is also a P1, the match on them would be 15% + 19% = 34% on their daily profit).
â€¢	P3: 
o	Requirements: 
ï‚§	Stake at least $400 yourself.
ï‚§	Have two separate teams where someone has reached the P2 rank. You need leaders one rank lower than the target rank in two separate teams.
o	Benefits: Higher matching percentage on level two and below.
â€¢	P4: 
o	Requirements: Not explicitly detailed in the sources, but follows the pattern of needing leaders at a lower rank in separate legs.
o	Benefits: Higher matching percentage on level two and below.
â€¢	P5 through P9: 
o	Requirements: Not explicitly detailed, but these are higher ranks.
o	Benefits: These ranks have a special advantage. Normally, if someone on one of your team legs reaches the same rank as you, you would earn zero differential on the volume under that leader (e.g., P4 matching a P4 results in 37% - 37% = 0%). However, if you are P5 or higher, and a leader on one of your legs also reaches the same rank (P5 through P9), you will still retain a 10% override match on the volume in that leader's organization. This makes P5 a "safe ground". If someone in your team is a higher rank than you, there is no differential earned on their volume.
The compensation plan rewards building up your leaders and helping them rank up, as this is how you qualify for higher ranks yourself, creating win-win situations. Earnings from indirect volume are based on a differential - the difference between your rank's matching percentage for that level and the rank's percentage of any leader below you on that leg.
Calculation Examples and Formula: The matching percentage is applied to the daily profit earned by the team members. For example, if a teammate stakes $100 at 1% per day, they earn $1 daily. A person with no rank gets a 15% match on this, earning 15 cents per day from that teammate. Over 360 days, this single teammate could contribute $54 in matching earnings.
Using a scenario where individuals stake $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000, respectively, all earning 1% daily:
â€¢	$1,000 stake earns $10/day. 15% match is $1.50/day.
â€¢	$2,000 stake earns $20/day. 15% match is $3.00/day.
â€¢	$3,000 stake earns $30/day. 15% match is $4.50/day. Total daily match from these three directs at 15% would be $1.50 + $3.00 + $4.50 = $9.00.
To calculate daily income when you are a P1 rank and there are no other ranks below you, you add the Direct Profit Match (DPM) and the Indirect Profit Match (IPM). Assuming a typical 1% daily staking return:
â€¢	Direct Profit Match (DPM) = Direct Volume * 1% * (15% + 10%) = Direct Volume * 1% * 25%.
â€¢	Indirect Profit Match (IPM) = Indirect Volume * 1% * 10%.
â€¢	Daily Income = DPM + IPM.
For instance, if you have three directs who each have $2,000 staked, and each of them has a team below them with $6,000 in volume (total indirect volume of $18,000):
â€¢	Direct volume: 3 * $2,000 = $6,000.
â€¢	DPM = $6,000 * 1% * 25% = $15 per day.
â€¢	Indirect volume: 3 * $6,000 = $18,000.
â€¢	IPM = $18,000 * 1% * 10% = $18 per day from each indirect leg, totaling $54 per day.
â€¢	Total Daily Income = $15 + $54 = $69 per day.
The sources emphasize running the numbers and doing simulations to see the potential earnings, highlighting that growth comes from tapping into this optional referral program by helping teammates earn and rank up. The results shown by the presenter, growing from around $500/day to over $676/day and having an available balance of over $1,700, illustrate the income potential from this plan.

2) Pop Max | Easy Step To Swap PPT To USDT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0O4IRzc6lM
1. Introduction: Pop Max Opportunity & Earning Potential
â€¢	Pop Max is described as a web3 AI social media platform that pays you to do what you're already doing on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram. This platform is said to be launching soon.
â€¢	There are reports of people in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, China, South Korea) making $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000+ per day on the platform. The source indicates this scale of earning hasn't yet been seen in the English-speaking market and represents an opportunity.
â€¢	You can earn 0.4% to 1% a day, 7 days a week, which translates to 12% to 30% a month.
â€¢	The native token, PPT, is described as an appreciating token that you can sell anytime.
2. Onboarding: Simplified Deposit & Staking Plans
â€¢	You can start with as low as $100.
â€¢	Previously, there was a friction point requiring users to buy half their deposit amount in PPT from an exchange. This required knowing where to buy and steps to do so.
â€¢	This friction has been alleviated. You can now deposit with 100% USDT BEP-20 on the Binance Smart Chain. If you have $100, you can deposit the full $100 in USDT, no longer needing 50% in USDT and 50% in PPT.
â€¢	Once deposited, you can start staking and earning.
â€¢	While the source doesn't explicitly list the staking plans in this excerpt, it refers to diving into the numbers of different staking periods, implying they exist and were likely covered elsewhere or are known.
3. Earning & Withdrawal: PUSD Stablecoin & Transfer
â€¢	You are ultimately paid and withdraw earnings in their native token called PBT, although later in the transcript, the internal stablecoin you receive is referred to as PUSD.
â€¢	PUSD is described as their internal stablecoin, one-to-one with USDT. This means One PUSD is equal to 1 USDT.
â€¢	Regardless of the price fluctuation of the PPT token on the market, you are getting paid in stablecoin (PUSD).
â€¢	To withdraw earnings, you first go to the "income page" and click on "transfer to asset balance". You can specify how much PUSD you want to withdraw, then click "transfer to balance" to receive the PUSD.
4. Conversion Step 1: Converting PUSD to PPT
â€¢	After transferring PUSD to your asset balance, you need to convert that PUSD into PPT.
â€¢	You can see the current exchange rate (e.g., the tutorial shows getting 1626 PPT for $314 PUSD).
â€¢	You enter the amount of PUSD to convert and click "swap".
5. Withdrawal Step 2: Withdrawing PPT to Web3 Wallet
â€¢	After converting PUSD to PPT, you go back to the asset page and click "withdraw".
â€¢	Enter the amount of PPT you want to withdraw.
â€¢	Click "withdraw to your wallet".
â€¢	The withdrawn PPT will land in your web3 wallet. Wallets mentioned include MetaMask, Bitget, Trust Wallet, and Safe Pal. If PPT doesn't show, you might need to search and add the POP social PPT token to your wallet.
6. Conversion Step 3: Converting PPT to USDT
â€¢	This is highlighted as a significant new feature simplifying the process.
â€¢	Old Methods: Previously, you would need to go to exchanges where PPT is listed and sell them. Exchanges mentioned where PPT is listed include Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, and NX1 [5, refers to listing on "top three of the top 10 exchanges"]. The source creator had made a video on selling on the NX1 exchange. Using exchanges involved "more steps".
â€¢	New Method (Web3 Wallet Swap): It was discovered that you can perform a swap on your web3 wallet (MetaMask, Bitget, Trust Wallet, Safe Pal) to convert PPT directly into USDT. This was initially disbelieved but confirmed to work.
â€¢	Step-by-step Wallet Swap Demonstration: 
o	Inside your wallet, tap "swap".
o	Select PPT as the token to swap FROM and USDT as the token to swap TO. (You can also swap PPT to BNB if needed for gas fees).
o	Enter the amount of PPT to swap. The source demonstrates swapping 100 PPT, noting the minimum withdrawal from POP is 100 PPT.
o	Check slippage. Slippage can fluctuate. Aim for anything under 5% if possible.
o	Confirm the swap and approve the transaction in your wallet.
o	After the swap processes, USDT will appear in your wallet.
â€¢	This wallet swap is seen as remarkable and a huge point for bringing in people who don't know exchange steps. It allows people to easily help teammates convert earnings. While learning to use exchanges is still recommended for the crypto space, the wallet swap offers ease of onboarding and getting first profits.
â€¢	It allows users to experience the full cycle of USDT in all the way to USDT out just from their web3 wallet.
7. Pop Max Substance & Growth
â€¢	The platform shows remarkable numbers of growth. The team balance grew significantly over two days (from $422,000 to $432,000 to $446,000), showing the team is growing and "good money" is starting to come in.
â€¢	Larger clients (20K+ clients) are in the works.
â€¢	Over time, Pop Max has proven there is substance. It's not just a staking model without backend infrastructure.
â€¢	Points indicating substance and credibility: 
o	Listed on three of the top 10 exchanges (implicitly Bybit, Bitget, MEXC) and working on OKX or Binance.
o	Has an actual product launching that is for the everyday person using social media, rewarding them in PPT for engagement (liking, commenting, sharing, posting). Users can then stake that PPT or sell it for USDT.
o	Forming partnerships with Punkverse, NX1, and other branches.
o	There is a developed digital footprint and an actual ecosystem.
o	The PPT circulating volume is decreasing (from 200 million down to 100 million), making it rarer.
o	People doing staking have to lock up PPT for 10 to 360 days, making it even rarer. This means people will pay more for PPT when they realize they need it for staking to earn.
o	There's thought and process behind the platform.
o	Leaders are beginning to come on board.
o	It has things on the blockchain and things that are credible from outside sources.
o	Partnerships and backers are described as immense and extremely credible.
o	Executives are from OKX and Binance.
â€¢	The platform combines innovative web3 with familiar social media to create an incentivized way to onboard the masses into the new economy.
â€¢	The source creator believes it is one of the best projects they have seen out of many pitched to them, having more substance and transparency than most (99%).
8. Conclusion & Support
â€¢	The opportunity is seen as being in the right place at the right time with the right opportunity.
â€¢	The new wallet swap feature allows for easier help in converting earnings.
â€¢	If you want help, you are encouraged to reach out to your sponsor. Links to team groups may be found in the description.
3) Pop Max | Sign Up + Funding Tutorial + $2,002 Deposit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8HsUKGCV0M
1. Pop Max Opportunity & Earning Potential
â€¢	Pop Max allows you to earn each and every day of the week.
â€¢	The earning potential is described as averaging 27% per month.
â€¢	Daily yields range from 0.4% to 1% a day, corresponding to 12% to 30% a month average depending on the staking period chosen.
â€¢	You can withdraw 7 days a week, even multiple times a day.
â€¢	Your principal is returned at the end of the term.
â€¢	There is a completely optional but very powerful referral program.
2. Getting Started & Account Connection
â€¢	You need the referral link of the person who shared the opportunity.
â€¢	Paste the link in your browser where you have already installed the extension of a decentralized wallet.
â€¢	Compatible wallets include MetaMask, BitGet, Trust Wallet, or Safe Pal, provided they have Binance Smart Chain capabilities.
â€¢	You'll need to have BNB in your wallet (a few dollars worth) as the gas fee for transactions.
â€¢	You also need USDT on the Binance Smart Chain of at least $100 or more.
â€¢	Click "connect wallet" in the upper right corner.
â€¢	Select your wallet and click "connect".
â€¢	Confirm the referral code.
â€¢	Click "register" and "agree".
â€¢	Ensure you are on the Binance BNB smart chain and hit "approve".
â€¢	You should then see your wallet address connected.
3. Making a Deposit (Staking)
â€¢	On the deposit page, you'll see slots for USDT and PPT.
â€¢	Previously, one deposit method required a 50/50 split of USDT and PPT in your wallet. For example, a $1,000 deposit required holding $500 in USDT and an equivalent amount in PPT.
â€¢	They have simplified this with an automatic proportioning toggle.
â€¢	By toggling this on, you can deposit the full amount as USDT. The platform will handle purchasing the other half in PPT on their end. This saves time and steps.
â€¢	Select the full amount you want to deposit (e.g., $2,002 demonstrated).
â€¢	Choose your staking period from the options: 
o	10 days for 0.4% a day
o	30 days for 0.5% a day
o	90 days for 0.6% a day
o	180 days for 0.8% a day
o	360 days for 1% a day (described as the most popular)
â€¢	Slide the arrow to initiate the deposit.
â€¢	Confirm the transaction and hit "approve" in your wallet.
â€¢	Ensure you have BNB to cover the gas fee.
â€¢	You will slide it one more time and click "mint now".
â€¢	An NFT is generated, representing your deposit and its benefits (e.g., daily profit percentage).
â€¢	After the deposit, the platform's backend converts half of your USDT deposit into PPT by purchasing it from exchanges.
â€¢	One reason for this process is creating utility on deposit and withdrawal.
â€¢	They also burn 10% of the PPT that is part of the deposit, aiming to reduce the total supply from 200 million to 100 million. Reducing supply and increasing demand is seen as good for the price.
4. Autocompounding Feature
â€¢	There is an "autocompounding" toggle.
â€¢	This feature means that at the end of your staking term, your principal and profits are automatically reinvested for another period of the same duration.
â€¢	It does not mean your daily profits are compounding daily.
â€¢	The source creator prefers to turn this off to have the option to decide whether to reinvest the principal, withdraw some, etc., at the end of the term. You can still withdraw daily profits regardless.
5. Earning and Withdrawal Process
â€¢	You will start seeing earnings within about 24 to 36 hours from when you make the deposit.
â€¢	Daily profits can be withdrawn.
â€¢	To process a withdrawal, click on the "income" button.
â€¢	Then click on "transfer to asset balance".
â€¢	Ensure you have BNB for the transactional fee.
â€¢	You are ultimately withdrawing or getting paid in a stablecoin called PUSD, which is their internal stable coin.
â€¢	Through a swap mechanism built directly into the back office, you can swap the PUSD into the PPT token.
â€¢	After swapping to PPT, you withdraw the PPT into your web3 wallet.
â€¢	If the PPT token doesn't show in your wallet, you need to add the PPT token by searching for "PPT" or "Pop Social" (look for the one with googly eyes) and adding it.
6. Referral Program
â€¢	Your referral code and link are found under the "team" button.
â€¢	It might not appear immediately after creating your account; you may need to refresh the page for it to populate.
â€¢	You can copy your referral link by clicking a button.
7. Additional Resources
â€¢	More training, presentations, and information are available in the team Telegram and Facebook groups, as well as the YouTube channel.
â€¢	You can reach out to your sponsor for additional help.

â€¢	Pop Max is described as a "hidden gem of an opportunity" and a "sleeping giant of a project" that is beginning to wake up.
â€¢	It allows users to earn each and every day.
â€¢	The earning potential is an average of 27% a month.
â€¢	The minimum to start is just $100.
â€¢	Users get paid daily.
â€¢	Users can withdraw multiple times a day.
â€¢	Withdrawals are completed under a minute.
â€¢	The principal is returned at the end.

â€¢	The source mentions staking periods are available from 180 to 360 days. (Note: The source refers to flyers with different periods but only explicitly mentions the longer ones in relation to an event qualification).
3. Getting Started & Referral Program
â€¢	The referral program is described as very powerful.
â€¢	The comp plan is a matching program on your team's daily earnings.
â€¢	It starts with 15% direct matching.
â€¢	This is highlighted as an ongoing, slow but consistent matching on daily profits, which is argued to be a better outcome and ultimately pays more than a one-time percentage match on the initial deposit. The CMO, Magnus, reportedly does the math on this in another video.
4. Earnings and Withdrawal Process
â€¢	The source creator showed their daily earnings growing from $309 per day on April 22nd to $383 per day by May 1st during an 8-day trip. Their current earnings shown in the video are $435 a day.
â€¢	Earnings are shown in an earnings pool.
â€¢	Team members joining are timestamped, and 24 hours from that time, they get paid, and the referrer gets the percentage override depending on rank.
â€¢	Earnings are growing "around the clock".
â€¢	To withdraw, you go to "transfer to asset balance".
â€¢	There is a 10% fee for the conversion withdrawal.
â€¢	The withdrawal is ultimately received as an internal stable coin called PUSD.
â€¢	For example, $1095.09 was transferred, resulting in $985.58 in PUSD after the fee.
â€¢	You can transfer PUSD to anyone else within the back office using a transfer function, by entering the amount and the recipient's PUSD wallet address.
â€¢	The next step is to swap the PUSD into PPT token.
â€¢	The source shows swapping $985.58 PUSD into 4,746 PPT tokens, with the PPT price shown as 20 cents at the time.
â€¢	Ensure you have BNB in your wallet to cover gas fees for withdrawals.
â€¢	You withdraw the PPT token from the Pop Max back office to a decentralized web3 wallet (e.g., BitGet wallet) that has Binance Smart Chain.
â€¢	You may need to refresh the wallet page for the balance to update.
5. Converting PPT to USDT using NX1 Exchange
â€¢	The source demonstrates using the NX1 exchange to convert the PPT token into USDT.
â€¢	NX1 is described as an official partnership with Pop Max.
â€¢	To use NX1, you need to deposit PPT to your specific PPT deposit address on the exchange. The source shows depositing 4,746 PPT (approx $985).
â€¢	Once deposited, you go to the trade section on NX1.
â€¢	Ensure the trading pair is PPT/USDT on the spot market (not futures).
â€¢	To convert PPT to USDT, you sell the PPT/USDT pair. You can enter the amount or slide to 100%.
â€¢	The order is placed, and within a minute or two, the balance switches from PPT to USDT.
â€¢	NX1 is currently accessible via a link in the video description for Android and iOS. It is not yet on app stores or desktop.
â€¢	You can use NX1 anywhere around the world without a VPN.
â€¢	It has minimal to no KYC requirements.
â€¢	To withdraw USDT from NX1, you go to the withdraw section.
â€¢	You can choose the USDT chain (Binance Smart Chain, TRC20, Soul, ERC20). The source demonstrates withdrawing via USDT TRC20.
â€¢	Paste your destination wallet address.
â€¢	Select the amount to withdraw.
â€¢	There is a $2 fee for USDT TRC20 withdrawal.
â€¢	A withdrawal email verification is required; you must click "get verification code" to trigger the email.
â€¢	A six-digit pin code (set by the user) is also required for security.
â€¢	The transaction receipt is viewable, and the USDT should land in the chosen wallet within a few minutes.
â€¢	This process completes the full cycle from starting with USDT in Pop Max, earning daily yield, withdrawing/converting to PUSD, swapping to PPT, withdrawing PPT to a web3 wallet, converting PPT to USDT on an exchange like NX1, and then sending the USDT out.
6. Token Details & Market Growth
â€¢	The PPT token is listed on Coin Market Cap.
â€¢	It is also listed on three of the top 10 exchanges globally: Bybit, BitGet, Mexi, and Gate.io.
â€¢	The 24-hour trading volume has grown significantly from under a million dollars to 6.1 million dollars. This growth is described as remarkable.
â€¢	This increased trading volume indicates things are "really starting to pick up".
7. Events & Community
â€¢	There is an upcoming Pop Max event in South Korea, on Guju Island.
â€¢	The dates have been moved to the first week of June.
â€¢	You can qualify for a fully compensated trip (flights and hotel accommodations).
â€¢	Qualification dates are from April 20th to May 20th.
â€¢	One way to qualify is to personally stake 10,000 USDT for 180 to 360 days, or have someone on your team do so.
â€¢	The source creator looks forward to visiting Guju Island.
â€¢	More content, including tutorials, presentations, and messages, is available on the team YouTube channel ("The Gifting Tribe") and in the team Telegram.

8. Personal Experience and Outlook
â€¢	The source creator describes themselves as a "bonafide workaholic" who missed working on Pop Max even while traveling in Japan. They enjoy the progress and the "gamification of business".
â€¢	Their daily earnings grew by about $75 in eight days while traveling, without their utmost attention.
â€¢	They track their daily effort using a counter app.
â€¢	They suggest reaching out to 100 people for 100 days could potentially 10x your income with Pop Max.
â€¢	They note that the English market has been "very much left behind" previously due to factors like being "lost in translation" and not having an English CMO, but this is changing.
â€¢	Leaders in Asia are reportedly making significant daily incomes ($1,000 to $5,000 a day), which is not yet common in the English market, highlighting the growth potential there.
â€¢	Things are "starting to pick up" with larger deposits coming in (e.g., multiple $10,000 deposits mentioned).
â€¢	People who have been in for months are now starting to refer others.
â€¢	The source creator aims to reach $700 a day in the next few weeks, anticipating a "leveraged effect" as more people get involved.
â€¢	They feel that the infrastructure ("The roads have been built now") is in place to "really go the distance".
â€¢	They encourage leveraging sponsors, leaders, and resources like the CMO to connect people to information and results.
â€¢	They urge capturing the market now before it becomes widely known.
â€¢	The day of recording felt "hyper productive" because the necessary content and infrastructure were in place.
2) Pop Max | All Time High Price + 2500 PPT Withdraw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HRpONZ20Bo
1. Pop Max / Pop Social Overview
â€¢	Pop Max is presented as an opportunity linked to Pop Social, described as a social media platform.
â€¢	It aims to pay the everyday user for spending time, energy, and attention on the platform, unlike traditional platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
â€¢	The platform leverages modern technology like blockchain, AI, and social finance.
â€¢	It rewards users in the platform's internal token.
â€¢	The platform is expected to have its full international launch at the end of the first quarter.
â€¢	However, users can start earning now through their staking protocol.
â€¢	It is presented as a brand new passive income opportunity.
2. Earning Potential and Staking
â€¢	Users can earn each and every day of the week, seven days a week.
â€¢	Daily earning rates range from 0.4% a day to 1% a day depending on the staking period.
â€¢	After accounting for a withdrawal fee, the monthly average payout is around 27% a month, though it can be more depending on selling price.
â€¢	The minimum to start is just $100.
â€¢	Users can have multiple stakings.
â€¢	Withdrawals of earnings can be done multiple times a day.
â€¢	The principal is returned at the end of the staking period. There is no fee on the principal withdrawal.
â€¢	Users can test the platform with staking periods as short as 10 days to see the daily earning and withdrawal process and principal return, then scale up.
â€¢	Staking periods available include 10 days (0.4% daily), 30 days (0.5% daily), 90 days (0.6% daily), 180 days (0.8% daily), and 360 days (1% daily). The 360-day option is described as the most popular.
â€¢	To stake, 50% of the amount must be in USDT on the Binance Smart Chain, and the other half must be in PPT token. The amount of PPT needed is calculated at the current market value.
â€¢	Users need some BNB in their web3 wallet for gas fees to confirm the staking transaction.
â€¢	An NFT will be created for each staking.
â€¢	10% of all PPT staked goes to a burning mechanism (dark hole wallet). This is intended to reduce the token supply from 200 million to 100 million.
3. Referral Program
â€¢	There is an optional but very powerful check match referral program.
â€¢	Everyone gets a referral link.
â€¢	The compensation plan is a matching program on your team's daily earnings.
â€¢	It starts with 15% direct matching on the daily earnings of anyone you directly refer (Frontline).
â€¢	For example, if a direct referral earns $1 a day, you earn 15% of that, which is $0.15 per day. This matching continues every day they get paid.
â€¢	As your Frontline collectively earns more (e.g., $10, $100, $1000 a day), your 15% match increases accordingly ($1.50, $15, $150 a day).
â€¢	To earn from Level 2 and beyond, you must reach P1 rank.
â€¢	P1 rank is unlocked by having three direct signups ($100 each minimum) and a collective team volume of 30,000.
â€¢	At P1, your direct matching increases to 25% (15% + 10% more), and you earn 10% on Level 2 and below until you encounter another P1 on that leg.
â€¢	To become a P2 rank, you need two P1s on two separate teams/legs (not necessarily direct) and a $200 staking in your own account.
â€¢	At P2, you earn a 19% differential, resulting in 34% direct matching (19% + 15%).
â€¢	To reach higher ranks, you generally need two individuals of the subsequent rank on separate teams.
4. PPT Token and Market Details
â€¢	The internal token is called PPT.
â€¢	PPT is used to process transactions, make purchases, unlock Treasure Chests, level up accounts, gain governance power, and can be earned by inviting friends and engaging with content on the Pop dApp.
â€¢	The total supply of PPT is 200 million tokens.
â€¢	There are burning mechanisms that will reduce the supply to 100 million, which includes 10% of staked PPT.
â€¢	PPT is listed on Coin Market Cap.
â€¢	It is listed on tier one exchanges: Bybit (second largest), BitGet, Mexi, Gate.io, and Biton.
â€¢	The price was recently pushing close to 15 cents per token. It had been in the 8-10 cent range for many weeks.
â€¢	The market capitalization is close to $12 million.
â€¢	The 24-hour trading volume was $2.5 million at one point, and on Bybit alone, it was $678,000 in a 24-hour period. Later in the source, it mentions 24-hour volume reached 6.1 million dollars (from a previous section, although this wasn't explicitly in the provided excerpts for the current query, it was in the thought process from the previous turn - checking sources again, this 6.1M figure is NOT in the provided text. I must stick only to the current sources. Okay, only 2.5M and 678k from Bybit are in the current sources.).
â€¢	The token is liquid in the market.
â€¢	You can find the contract address on popsocial.io to add the token to your wallet.
â€¢	The NX1 exchange is mentioned for converting PPT to USDT.
â€¢	NX1 is described as having an official partnership with Pop Max. The source demonstrates using NX1 to convert PPT to USDT.
â€¢	NX1 is accessible via a link in the video description for Android and iOS but not on app stores or desktop yet.
â€¢	You can use NX1 anywhere around the world with minimal to no KYC requirements
5. Withdrawal and Conversion Process
â€¢	Earnings accumulate in an earnings pool.
â€¢	To withdraw earnings, click on "transfer to asset balance".
â€¢	There is a 10% fee on the profits (not the principal) for this transfer.
â€¢	After transferring, the earnings are held as PUSD, the internal stable coin of the platform, pegged to USDT. This internal PUSD cannot be withdrawn directly.
â€¢	The next step is to swap the PUSD into PPT token at the current market value. This is a technique to get more PPT if the price is lower. The source shows swapping PUSD into 2,448 PPT.
â€¢	After the swap, the balance is in PPT token in the asset balance. This is the token that can be withdrawn.
â€¢	To withdraw the PPT, go to the withdraw section. The wallet used to sign into the dApp is already connected.
â€¢	Enter or select the maximum amount of PPT to withdraw and slide the withdrawal button.
â€¢	Confirm the transaction on your connected web3 wallet. You need a small amount of BNB in your wallet to cover gas fees for this withdrawal
â€¢	The withdrawal is sent to your web3 wallet (e.g., BitGet). It landed within a minute in the demonstration. You may need to refresh the wallet to see the updated balance.
â€¢	To convert the PPT from your web3 wallet into USDT, you need to use one of the exchanges where PPT is listed, such as Mexi.
â€¢	On the exchange, you need to deposit PPT to your specific deposit address for that token.
â€¢	Once deposited, go to the spot trading section and select the PPT/USDT pair.
â€¢	To convert PPT to USDT, you sell the PPT/USDT pair. You can sell at the market price.
â€¢	After the sell order is successful, the balance on the exchange is in USDT.
â€¢	To withdraw the USDT from the exchange (Mexi in the example), go to the withdraw section.
â€¢	Select the USDT chain (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Tron chain, Ethereum chain). The example uses the Binance Smart Chain.
â€¢	Paste the destination wallet address.
â€¢	Enter the amount to withdraw.
â€¢	A verification code needs to be obtained via email by clicking the "get code" button.
â€¢	A six-digit pin code or Google Authenticator code (if set up as an alternative to KYC) is required to submit the withdrawal. Mexi does not require KYC for a "pretty decent amount of volume".
â€¢	The withdrawal process can be tracked and is pending before being confirmed. The USDT landed in the destination wallet in the demonstration.
6. Technology and Platform Features

POP MAX WEEKLY CALL UPDATE

POP MAX WEEKLY CALL UPDATE(INFO IN DETALIS)
1) Pop Max | Weekly Update On Comp Plan/ Nxone/ Partnerships
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqJWrNt-m94&t=777s
Introduction and Topics Overview The session is hosted by Magnus and is a weekly leadership call. The goal is to help individuals develop their market and benefit from current developments. The planned topics include an explanation of the bonus system, different staking options, the powerful ecosystem, and a vision for the future.
Bonus System Explanation Many people misunderstand the bonus system.
â€¢	Direct Referral Earnings: There is a 15% direct referral earning. However, this is not 15% of the initial staking principle. Instead, you earn 15% on the daily rewards your personally referred individuals receive from their staking. For example, if someone stakes $1,000 at 1% a day, receiving $10 daily, you earn 15% of that $10, which is $1.50 per day. Over 360 days, this amounts to $540 on a $1,000 stake, which is presented as significantly better than receiving $150 (15% of the $1,000 principle). The system prefers paying on people's earnings rather than their spendings. You always receive 15% on personal referrals as long as you are active.
â€¢	Team Earnings: You can earn from 10% up to 82% of your team's earnings (staking rewards), not their principle. To get paid on your team, you need to reach the rank of P1. 
o	P1 Rank: To reach P1, you need to personally sponsor a minimum of three people. These three people, combined with everyone else in your team, must reach $30,000 in total staking volume. Reaching P1 opens up a 10% earning on your entire team's staking rewards (income).
o	Earnings as P1: On your personally referred individuals (who are also part of your team), you earn the initial 15% plus an additional 10% from team earnings, totaling 25%. On the rest of your team, you earn 10% of their earnings.
o	P2 Rank: To reach P2, you need two separate legs (personally sponsored individuals) each reaching the P1 rank.
o	Earnings as P2: As a P2, your team earning percentage increases from 10% to 19%. On your personally referred individuals, you earn 15% plus the 19% open line percentage. However, if a person in your team is a P1, they take their 10% team earning, and you receive the difference from your 19%, meaning you get 9% from the P1 line downwards. This applies to multiple P1 legs. As a P2, you have 19% in what's called "open line" (where no P1 or higher rank breaks you off) and 9% below any P1s. The two main bonuses to understand are personal and team earnings. Higher ranks like P5 and P9 exist but are not discussed in depth at this time.
Staking Options The system is described as powerful beyond just standard staking. It includes Yield Pool Distribution.
â€¢	Standard Staking: Staking for 360 days at 1% a day. 
o	$500 Stake: Daily return $5, weekly $35, monthly $150. Total return after 360 days is $1,800, plus the $500 principle is returned.
o	$1,000 Stake: Daily return $10, weekly $70, monthly $300. Total return after 360 days is $3,600, plus the $1,000 principle.
o	$5,000 Stake: Daily return $50, weekly $350, monthly $1,500. Total return after 360 days is $18,000, plus the $5,000 principle.
o	$10,000 Stake: Daily return $100, weekly $700, monthly $3,000. Total return after 360 days is $36,000, plus the $10,000 principle. Staking is like locking in or lending out your money, with no cost to be part of POPMAX.
â€¢	Staking with Yield Pool Distribution: When people withdraw from the PUSD pool, there is a 10% withdrawal fee. 50% of this fee is distributed back to those who keep funds in the PUSD pool (the yield pool). This distribution adds to the staking rewards, especially over longer periods due to compounding effects. 
o	$500 Stake (with Yield Pool): After 7 days: $71 (compared to $35 standard). After 30 days: $324 (compared to $150 standard). After 360 days: $1,800 (standard return) + $16,000 (yield pool) = $18,310 total.
o	$1,000 Stake (with Yield Pool): After 360 days: $3,600 (standard) + $33,000 (yield pool) = $36,620 total.
o	$5,000 Stake (with Yield Pool): After 360 days: $18,000 (standard) + $165,000 (yield pool) = $183,000 total.
o	$10,000 Stake (with Yield Pool): After 360 days: $36,000 (standard) + $366,280 (yield pool) = $402,280 total. The yield pool distribution is not fixed; it varies depending on the number of people withdrawing from the pool. As Pop Max grows and more people join and withdraw, more yield should be paid out.
Pop Ecosystem The ecosystem is crucial for the token's value.
â€¢	Pop Social: The core platform at the center. It is a global creator economy engine powered by AI and built on Web 3, bridging Tik Tok-style content with Telegram-style communities. It aims to build a decentralized traffic empire where users can create, interact, build communities, and earn. Most social media users spend time but don't earn; Pop Social aims to change this by turning voices into assets. Users are rewarded in PPT for using the app, inviting friends, and creating content. It is accessible today at popsocial.io.
â€¢	POP: Described as the growth engine that accelerates ecosystem expansion and optimizes the token economy, acting as fuel for user engagement. "This is us," referring to the members supporting the ecosystem.
â€¢	NX1: The financial hub. It is an AI-powered centralized exchange launched in 2024. It facilitates token liquidity, trading, and serves as a core pillar for asset realization and financial credibility. It is currently operational but not heavily promoted yet. It is available on Android for direct download and via a test pilot version for App Store. 
o	Features: Includes powerful AI strategies (claiming returns like 3,598% on AI hedged strategies). Supports spot trading, futures, AI strategies (bots where you deposit funds and they trade for you), copy trading, arbitrage, and swap.
o	NX Rise: Their own launchpad for companies wanting to go to market. The NX1 team assists them.
o	NX Nova: An airdrop platform for new projects to reach out and distribute tokens.
o	Virtual NX Card: A virtual crypto payment card for online payments.
o	Global Presence & Compliance: NX1 has a global team and offices in North America (New York), Europe (Estonia), Asia (Singapore), South America (Sao Paulo, Brazil), and Africa (Mauritius). They have partners like Visa, Mastercard, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. They prioritize compliance and localization. NX1 holds MSB licenses in the United States (registered with FinCEN), Singapore (with MAS), and Kazakhstan. They also have an EMI license in the European Union and an MSB in Canada.
o	VARA License: NX1 has paid a $1 million fee to be on the list for the VARA license (similar to those held by major exchanges like Binance and OKX) and is under supervision. They anticipate receiving this license in the next 6 to 8 months, which is considered very important.
o	Visibility: NX1 attends various events and summits globally, including Token 2049 in Singapore and Dubai, Dubai 2024, and Hong Kong Web Summit. The CEO of NX1, Simon, was pictured with Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, at Token 2049 in Dubai.
â€¢	Pop Social Token (PPT): The core asset and lifeblood of the ecosystem. It is used to earn, trade, and fuel transactions. It is considered very important. Information is available on CoinMarketCap. 
o	Supply: Total supply of 200 million tokens, planned to be reduced to 100 million through deflationary mechanisms. Circulating supply is 85 million.
o	Market Cap: Current circulating market cap is $18 million (fully diluted is $40 million). The company target is a $1 billion market cap before the end of this year, representing a potential increase of 55 times or 5,455% from the current circulating market cap.
â€¢	Punk Verse: Metaverse integration, specifically VR and NFT experience stores bridging Web 2 and Web 3. It serves as a real-world gateway into digital asset cognition and offline brand activation. It aims to build a highly engaged community through NFTs and offline experiences and become a sustainable creator empire leveraging IP, metaverse expansion, and tokenomics. 
o	Locations & Growth: Currently has over 40 locations in China and is growing. The first VR experience store outside China is in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Stores are being prepared in more locations in China. Future locations could include South Korea, Dubai, Stockholm, Malmo, Islamabad, etc., depending on PopMax's growth and success.
o	Income Base: Income comes from entrance fees (VR experience). Stories report roughly 100,000 visitors per month. Other income sources include contacting city tourism (e.g., Ho Chi Minh) to create VR content about tourist attractions. Local companies also pay to be part of the metaverse or have VR experiences created about their business.
o	Ownership Model: The company will own 50% of a Punk Verse store, and the other 50% will be available for crowdfunding by members. Members can participate and become profit holders of Punk Verse stores in various locations.
o	IPO: When Punk Verse reaches a certain turnover, it is expected to have an IPO and be listed on NASDAQ, likely starting next year, which could be interesting for members.
o	Exclusive Games: The Punk Verse team creates their own VR games (e.g., hunting game, Counter-Strike style) that are only available in the physical stores, encouraging repeat visits.
o	Note: PopMart is mentioned as a similar concept that will be discussed next week to show potential revenue generation.
â€¢	POPX: Described as the wealth generator. It is a powerful passive income engine launching later this year. It may include staking revenue sharing and Web 3 DeFi innovations.
â€¢	PopChain: The backbone, a proprietary blockchain tailored for content and social applications, launching next year (Q2 2026). It will have on-chain transparency and use PPT as the gas token. 
o	Launch Process: When the mainnet launches, it will first connect directly to Pop Social. Then PPT will be put on the chain, followed by NX1, POP Max, POPX, and parts of Punk Verse. Everything happening on these parts of the ecosystem will require PPT as a transaction fee.
o	Growth Potential: The PopChain is expected to become bigger because more and more companies, entrepreneurs, and projects are already lining up to use it as their blockchain. When external projects use PopChain, they will also use PPT as transaction fees. This increases the circulation and demand for PPT while the supply is reducing.
o	Integration with NX1: PopChain combined with NX1's Launchpad (NX Rise) and Airdrop platform (NX Nova) allows for launching new projects. Holding PPT in your wallet will qualify you to receive airdrops from projects launching on PopChain via NX Nova.
o	Future Market Cap Target: With PopChain launched and more projects running on it, the company's target valuation/market cap is $5 billion. This is an increase of 277 times or 27,000% from the current circulating market cap.
Future Vision The company is working towards a unified login experience. When you connect your wallet or log in, you will have options to access your assets in NX1, go to Pop Social, or access POPMAX. The vision is that growth in Pop Social will drive users to NX1 and other parts of the ecosystem, allowing users to earn rewards in Pop Social and then directly stake or sell them within the same app. This unified access opens up many opportunities.
The speaker hopes the audience is inspired and understands that they are building the future together.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSzN74chAYI&t=62s
I. Introduction and Context
â€¢	The company has been operating since 2023.
â€¢	The business is described as "very short so far but very lucrative".
â€¢	Most attendees have recently started with the company.
â€¢	The video focuses on understanding the whole ecosystem of Pop Social and its current power.
â€¢	The latest endeavor is PopMax, launched "just two months ago" for users to take advantage and support the ecosystem.
II. Pop Social (Core Platform)
â€¢	Pop Social is described as the core of the ecosystem, in the middle of everything.
â€¢	It aims to bring the next billion users to web3.
â€¢	This is achieved by decentralizing content ownership and powering the AI creator economy.
â€¢	Pop Social will "bridge the gap between traditional social media and the web 3 social experience".
â€¢	The platform has been operating for "over a year ago".
â€¢	It has over 500,000 registered users.
â€¢	It has a valuation of over 40 million.
â€¢	Hitting "the magic number of over 1 million members" is expected to make the valuation "skyrocket".
â€¢	Pop Social built a social platform infrastructure to accelerate web3 abstraction and mass adoption.
â€¢	It features a reward-based system where users get rewarded with the native PPT token for actions like inviting others, unlike platforms like TikTok or Facebook. This is cited as a reason for fast growth.
â€¢	The platform and revenue model were initially planned to be fully self-sustaining within the first few years, but the speaker now believes they are already self-sustaining due to the powerful ecosystem.
â€¢	There are several institutional investors who participated in the seed round in October 2023.
â€¢	These investors are also part of the Pop Social board, acting as a safety net by participating in daily decision-making.
â€¢	The company is already on CoinMarketCap.
â€¢	Founders have a "very good" background as former executives from Binance and OKX, which is seen as a potential "head start" or "quicker way to get listed on those two exchanges".
III. PopMax
â€¢	PopMax is the "latest endeavor" where the audience and speaker have joined.
â€¢	It is described as a way to take advantage and support the ecosystem.
â€¢	It is presented as a decentralized ecosystem with an innovation and development foundation.
â€¢	Key objectives include: supporting ecosystem projects, optimizing token economics, promoting user participation, and driving ecosystem growth. These are achieved through actions like buying/staking PPT (supporting projects, optimizing token economics by creating circulation) and inviting friends (promoting participation, driving growth).
â€¢	It offers multiple staking contracts.
â€¢	A "revolutionary option" highlighted is the ability to earn interest on your interest.
â€¢	Daily staking rewards and team earnings accumulate in the PUSD pool.
â€¢	Funds can be withdrawn from the PUSD pool at any time with "no restrictions".
â€¢	However, leaving funds in the PUSD pool allows users to receive a daily yield pool distribution.
â€¢	There is a 10% withdrawal fee on funds taken from the PUSD pool.
â€¢	This 10% withdrawal fee does not go to the company but goes into the yield pool.
â€¢	The yield pool distribution is allocated: 50% to users holding funds in the PUSD pool, 40% to node holders, and 10% to an education fund.
â€¢	Observed daily yield pool percentages range from 0.65% to 1.3%.
â€¢	An average calculation shows roughly 0.975% daily yield pool distribution.
â€¢	Combined with potential staking rewards (e.g., 1% a day for 360 days), the total daily earning potential is suggested to be almost 2% a day.
â€¢	PopMax is credited with having "huge success" and having "truly made magic so far" for the PPT token.
IV. Punk Verse
â€¢	Described as "mastering the metaverse" and "Pop Social's new frontier".
â€¢	It is presented as an offline version of the metaverse.
â€¢	The purpose is to get higher retention, boost learning outcomes, and address the challenge of onboarding "web2 people" who are new to web3 concepts like wallets and MetaMask.
â€¢	Users can visit these "offline metaverse" facilities to learn and understand Pop Social and web3.
â€¢	This approach is expected to facilitate faster adoption, potentially onboarding "up to 50%" through this tech implementation.
â€¢	Punk Verse locations are where "culture meets the metaverse".
â€¢	These are metaverse experiences built on top of virtual events, NFT galleries, merchant stores (over the counter), and more.
â€¢	Users can use VR glasses to enter, see Pop Social branding, and build awareness.
â€¢	A key feature is that all turnover from Punk Verse "will swapped into PPT" to increase daily circulation on the market.
â€¢	There are over 40 such stores in China, one in Vietnam, with plans for expansion to major cities globally like Dubai and South Korea.
V. PPT Token
â€¢	The PPT token fuels the social economy of Pop Social.
â€¢	The initial total supply is 200 million. This is highlighted as relatively low compared to projects with billions of tokens.
â€¢	There is a deflationary mechanism designed to reduce the total supply down to 100 million tokens.
â€¢	The current circulating supply is roughly 85 million, viewable on CoinMarketCap.
â€¢	Based on the 85 million circulating supply, the current market cap is approximately 18 million.
â€¢	The company's first target market cap for the PPT token is 1 billion. This represents a potential 55 times or 5,455% increase from the current value.
â€¢	The first token burn event has occurred, burning 546,969 tokens by sending them to a burn address (0.0000...). Burned tokens can never be restored.
â€¢	Token burns are expected to happen "more and more and more often".
â€¢	10% of staking amounts of PPT "will be put into the burn mechanism".
â€¢	Increasing token value is linked to mechanisms like staking to receive daily rewards and yield pool distribution, and then swapping to PPT.
â€¢	The PPT token currently runs on the BNB Binance chain.
VI. NX1
â€¢	NX1 is a centralized cryptocurrency exchange that launched in 2024.
â€¢	It is part of the Pop Social ecosystem and described as "our own exchange".
â€¢	It features AI-powered trading tools.
â€¢	Services include spot trading and futures.
â€¢	It has a launchpad called NX Rise.
â€¢	It has an airdrop platform called NX Nova.
â€¢	It includes a crypto payment card called NX Card, available virtually via the app.
â€¢	NX1 is "not fully launched yet" but has licenses and corporations in place.
â€¢	It is expected to be a "very important part of the whole ecosystem".
VII. Pop X Fund
â€¢	This is a new thing planned for launch "later this year".
â€¢	It is described as a "powerful mechanism for you in wealth creation".
â€¢	Further details are not available at this moment. It is something to look forward to as it is expected to enhance the ecosystem, create more economy, and more wealth.
VIII. PopChain
â€¢	The launch of the PopChain mainnet is planned for "next year".
â€¢	This will be Pop Social's "own primary blockchain network".
â€¢	The native cryptocurrency of PopChain will be required for gas fees when sending funds or doing anything on the chain. This is expected to increase the circulation of that token.
â€¢	The company's second market cap target, linked to the launch of PopChain, is 5 billion. This represents a potential 277 times or 27,677% increase in token value from the current $18M market cap.
â€¢	Launching the chain is also expected to help reduce the total amount of the token.
IX. Supporting Initiatives and Concepts
â€¢	Beam IO channel: A tool providing presentations with voiceovers and subtitles in multiple languages (English, French, Korean, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Hindi, Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese).
â€¢	Events: Attending events (like the past one in Vietnam and planned one in South Korea) is highly recommended. 
o	Events are seen as increasing "belief" and leading to doubled or tripled "turnover".
o	The event in South Korea is seen as an opportunity to "understand more about the company," "see the company," and "meet the company and all the leaders".
o	Something "huge" is expected at the South Korea event, potentially the launch of a new Pop Social app.
â€¢	Team Building: Earning potential exists through building a team. 
o	There is a 15% direct referral bonus on all personal referrals.
o	Team payments are received "on the fully team" when reaching P1 rank or higher.
o	Building a large team now for staking could lead to earnings tripling easily overnight if new products are launched.
â€¢	Proof of Concept: The existence of the Pop Social app with over 500,000 registered users and a $40M+ valuation serves as proof of concept.
â€¢	Exchange Listings: Being already listed on CoinMarketCap and having founders from Binance/OKX suggests the possibility of faster listing on top exchanges. The speaker mentions top exchanges globally ranked from 2nd to 13th place by volume, including Bybit (number two after Binance).
X. Conclusion
â€¢	The Pop Social ecosystem is described as "very powerful" with most things already in place.
â€¢	The current opportunity is to utilize this by participating in PopMax through staking and team building.
â€¢	The speaker believes "we're sitting on something magical" but emphasizes that action from individuals is required for success.
