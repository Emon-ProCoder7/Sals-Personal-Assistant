Certainly, here are the transcriptions from the YouTube video sources provided, presented 
exactly as they appear in the sources: 
$7 Program | A Million Dollar Plan 
• if you're getting this video from me then I consider you someone that I can send a quick 
informal video and a first PowerPoint presentation that I haven't done any presentation on 
this project but I consider you someone that knows me someone that uh we've done 
business before someone that knows this industry as well and I like me you may be 
frustrated about having to restart your team over and over and over and over um and 
looking for something to have as a legacy project I went as far as looking at health and 
wellness projects uh travel projects something outside of the volatility of passive 
programs um because they tend to not be around um a year is is lucky if you get uh that 
in these programs but something very interesting is happening in a program that I know 
the the creator of from many years back but over a year ago um he told me about this idea 
he has by the way he has made tens of millions of dollars in this space probably close to4 
50 million in one project and so he is putting his money to making this platform which is 
I think going to be a home base for uh um so many of us and and I'll explain through the 
presentation slide why I think that is the case but main point of this video is to to to get 
across to you that if you have $7 plus $50 before Valentine's Day at a certain time lock in 
this like early bird position because it has a million dooll possible uh um payout if you 
meet some other uh Team requirements over two years but if you don't get in before that 
time on Valentine's Day with the7 and $50 then um the requirements are higher and and 
and if I can put you guys in a better position to make such uh an amount um with less 
requirements and we have the time to do that um then then why not so let's dive in to this 
$7 program which I absolutely think is going to change the game change the industry 
change uh our approach to it so this is the main problem in our space which is there's too 
many scams uh MLM crypto MLM crypto tokens and unsustainable daily Roi programs 
have a proven 99% failure rate unethical owners create fake schemes that low innocent 
with greed and fear of missing out only to steal their money even ethical leaders have 
been caught out of these lies absolutely true the solution ow 
• really is needed in our industry talk to you guys soon peace 
$7 Program | BIG Money Comp Plan 
• early and on time which is awesome so uh I'm just going to get straight into it and then uh 
others will jump on as they do as we go on So today we're going to focus on the 
compensation plan and how to maximize the earnings from that so uh one second let 
silence my devices there you go so yeah to make the most of the Compensation Plan um 
there's a lot of power in it you just need to see where it is I'm going to cover exactly 
where that is and uh for those that might be new here for the first time I'll do a quick 
overview on the vision and the project so just do that thank you for joining us today thank 
you for uh listening to the person who invited you here today and coming along with an 
open mind whoever's sharing this uh opportunity with you has done so because they care 
and you're about to witness something that's pretty extraordinary something quite unique 
and different than uh anything you may have seen before Before we start please take a 

screenshot of the income disclaimer and make sure you read that in your own good time 
it simply says that there's no guarantees of daily return on investment program being 
offered here there's no uh like uh fixed income programs or anything like that what we're 
going to show you is a real platform that allows you to earn from real businesses and it 
really is as simple as that so funnny enough as simple as it is it's a revolutionary idea 
nobody's done it yet uh one single platform called my business club with unlimited 
opportunities built inside of that club all right so you become a member of the club and 
then you get exclusive access to the phenomenal deals and the focus of the deals that 
we're going to bring to the table going forward is around wealth building and wealth 
creation all right so intention is everything and I've often said this you can have really 
really low quality products and services and you know build huge businesses just to scam 
people which is often what happens out there in the world right unethical cloners that 
create elaborate schemes to steal from people that's quite common is quite normal on the 
internet and often times people with great intentions good leaders good people get caught 
out by the sophisticated scammers and so it's the intention of 
BitFoot | Automatically Copy Million Dollar Meme Wallets 
• he description of course you're more than welcome to get back to the person that has 
shared this with you to begin your journey but I am seeing something unique and it's 
definitely worth checking out peace it's called bitf foot and quickly said bitf fooot is the 
fastest trading platform that's out there you might have heard of sniper Bots because it's 
more trending in the Miko market and quickly explained what is a sniper bot sniper bot is 
a tool that helps you especially in the decentralized market for meme coins to buy faster 
and to sell faster why is speed so important because everybody who traded in mcoins 
know that the market is way more volatile than the crypto space why because the market 
capitalization is way smaller meaning a little volume can already increase the price a lot 
There's a lot of charts a lot of new tokens launched where you can see in the minute chart 
that the price increases for 80% in only one or two minutes and if you do manual 
transactions for example for UNIS swap for phantom for other wallets these transactions 
can take up to for example 15 seconds and if you're unlucky and the price surg is too high 
the slippage is too high then the transaction fails and you have to do it one more time 
meaning then you are 30 seconds 45 seconds or even 60 seconds later in the market than 
you actually wanted to do so you're missing out on profits on every entry and on every 
exit and that's where sniper bot is essential and that's also one reason why every mcoin 
Trader that's doing it on regular basis and doing it professionally use as a sniper bot 
because you can enter the market faster you can exit the market faster and here with bitf 
foot we are the fastest sniper bot that's on the market and I always say okay people can 
easily say we are the fastest and PDFs can also easily be editable that's why we also have 
the proof where we show the people because we are openly showing everything how the 
action is really working I can show you right away how this whole proof that we share 
also with the community and will be also available to you to share with others where on 
the right side we can see a wallet which is doing manually a transaction on the left side 
we see right now the top five best sniper bots 
• on the market we have banana gun we have myestro we have ubot and we have Trojan 
and on the other side also bitf foot All those sniper Bots are connected through copy 

trading with this wallets that will do now a manual transaction and you will see how fast 
every of those sniper Bots recognizes the transaction and then execute it very important 
to understand recognizing is not executing because you will see that there's other sniper 
Bots that also recognize at the same time as bitford but they don't execute and execution 
means that from this moment you are in the market and not from just recognizing so I 
will share this real quick with you you can see here the swap transaction is being done 
and in the same second you can see it's done bito right away already recognized the 
transaction Trojan also detected the transaction but if we look closely we see here bitford 
as the very first one only like a few milliseconds later also already executes the 
transaction on the open market market And here comes the big big Edge because if you 
look closely now how long the other sniper Bots need to execute because you can see 
here detected buy copy but it's still not executed as it's showing private transaction sent 
waiting for result so here we will see okay it's 2 seconds it's 3 seconds it's 4 seconds now 
it's the next one the transaction executes successfully and from then on we can see further 
that it also happens for example on one side we've done myestro executing and on the 
other side that with' also Trojan and banana gun so here we have an edge really with the 
speed over the market and especially when we talk about copy trading it's even more 
interesting because you have to imagine there is Insider wallets out there and people that 
are following those wallets and if people use a slower sniper bot and you use the fastest 
one and following this uh Insider wallet you will always be on First Position meaning the 
people that use the slower bot will be your volume that you can already use as profit 
that's number one and why speed is so essential Coming to the second part which bitf 
also provides and that is our Academy section Here all the people get access to our 
ultimate sniper Community where they get the knowledge like o 
• ne of our experts in the team that made in the last mcoin cycle seven figures and profit 
and he shares his knowledge his strategies with everybody we have a community chat we 
will have weekly calls and we will also have a video Academy section where we'll dive 
deep into those themes like finding for example new coins what to look out for what are 
the for sniping strategies mecoin dip strategies where we look at the structure and show 
you how to find the best entries and I think what's most interesting for everybody is how 
to find find and copy those Elite Traders We also like to call them Insider wallets because 
if you look at the price structure of mean coins you mostly see the same thing at the 
bottom only a few Traders enter then the price surges for like 5 10 20 x and then they sell 
with the most profit and the reason why they enter so low and can make so big profits 
mostly is because of Insider information that's why we call them inside wallets and the 
good thing here is as the blockchain is completely transparent it's possible to track those 
traders to find out their wallet and to copy and paste them into our sniper bot meaning 
from that moment if this Trader also has in five days or in 10 days another Insider 
information and buys the token you don't have to do anything because his wallet is 
connected to yours through our copy trading system and in the same moment he buys 
your wallet also executes the same trade in the same moment he sells with profit your 
wallet executes the same trait So how does this look in action I can show you right away 
so here for example we have the sniper bot active on our Telegram and for us it was 
really important to make the onboarding as simple as possible meaning you just start the 
bot and from there you click on copy trade So from the moment where you click on copy 
trade you just can insert a wallet that you found on one side that we as a community give 

out to everybody and on the other side also through the academy we show how we select 
wallets and finds them so you can also take the strategy and look out for wallets every 
single day also by yourself so here when you want to add a wallet what you do you click 
on ADD wallet you give it a name for example task one I have th 
• en an address I can type in here and then I just confirm an ad If I confirm on ad the wallet 
is then implemented in here and from that moment every single trans ction that this wallet 
is doing my wallet is also executing The best part here is because some people will ask 
okay but some Traders they trade with 5,000 with 3,000 with 2,000 I don't have that kind 
of money so we also implemented here another setting which when you click on the 
wallet itself it's called amount mode So here I can click on it and I can type in for 
example 0.1 salana meaning from that moment it doesn't matter if the trader trades with $ 
10,000 000 with 5,000 with 50 my wallet will execute it with 0.1 Solana meaning $15 So 
the full control is on your side and you don't have to worry that you lose everything with 
one trade because the settings you can individually paste in and trade like you want and 
the best part of it is the user himself is 100% in control meaning there is no third party 
that is working with your money or you are giving your money away but the money is 
always on your wallet and you can withdraw every single second everything You can 
withdraw every single second every profit and you even have the possibility in an active 
copy trade for example the trader wants to sell at 200% but you say Okay 120% is 
enough for me you can manually close the trade and also withdraw that amount So 100% 
control on the user side I think that's a very very important point here and from the 
moment where we have the copy trade activated you don't have to do anything you will 
just get the notifications when our software recognizes a transaction This will look like 
that and you will get the notification on telegram meaning it will show you for five salana 
this Trader bought for example Zasha and my wallet copied for 0.1 Solana that trade he 
bought for 0. Solana and he sold for 35% Same thing a little bit later he bought lar for 0.1 
Solana and he sold for 41% And I think here a very important part is also the automatic 
marketing So here we wanted to make it as simple as possible to share this results 
meaning that every time a trade is closed you will immediately get a picture showing you 
the details of the trade the token that you bought how long y

Pop Max | $435/Day + Live Withdraw (Sleeping Giant) 
• hey there PopMax Tribe Guess who's back from his 36th country Can you tell by the cool 
hat of a tiger fighting a dragon in the midst of cherry blossoms that it was Japan And you 
know what I realized in this wonderful tour and adventure of this magical land of uh 

weird culture and amazing cuisine and climate it is that I realized that I am a bonafide 
workaholic Uh in the midst of all this beauty and all of this culture and all of the diversity 
to dive into of this new way of life I was itching like just trying to get back to you guys 
trying to get back to like a few minutes of working And uh I realized how much I enjoy 
the progress that uh we get to make by sitting at our phones or laptops or wherever we 
may be And this gamification of business that uh we get to participate in it is something 
that when you step away you realize how fun it can be With that being said I have so 
much updates for you guys I've been working behind the scenes creating some wonderful 
content that if you have not make sure to watch them you can find all of them in our team 
YouTube channel the gifting tribe starting with this video here which is a great 3minut 
sizzle video that summarizes the big picture of what pop social is and our participation in 
it and then if you want a presentation that covers both the the concept of the social media 
that rewards us plus the business elements and the comp plan and how you make profits 
on profits This is now our 18minute presentation that covers all of it Uh if you want this 
video to upload onto your own platforms let me know I can send that file to you And then 
over here we have the weekly update call by Magnus the CMO chief marketing officer of 
Pop Max With that being said let's dive into some quick little uh photo uh uh reel of uh 
my ventures in Japan which I was very much looking forward to This is me with a train A 
lot of cool trains there There's a place where if you bow down to deers they also bow 
down and they're trained kind of to do that because then you reward them with food This 
was a really cool day of seeing a lot of temples and uh other Japanese just architecture 
and things Now I bring that up because if you want to visit Asia there is a PopMax event 
happening like the one that happe 
• how many people I reached out to and touched base with By the way this app is called 
counter or you could find any counter app But this is like a means by which I can track 
my effort in the day And I urge you if you want to change your life reach out to a 100 
people for the next 100 days Your your your income can 10x uh whatever you're making 
here with pop It's just a small little sample of what is possible if we put more fuel into the 
fire So let's dive deeper into what we have in uh the rest of what I want to show you here 
Oh more pictures So if you guys want uh you know to be able to take these pictures 
yourself come meet the company in South Korea in what seems to be a really cool place 
I'm hearing called Guju Island I've been to South Korea but never this island So looking 
forward to that adventure Um and then here again the website of POP and all that stuff 
what they're aiming to do Uh great little interview with Michael Shen the CEO of Pop 
Social The token not only listed on Coin Market Cap but listed on three of the top 10 
exchanges in the world Bybit BitGet Mexi Gate.io all listed It's incredible to have this 
from day one Look at this For those of you guys that have been around you may have 
remembered when the 24-hour trading volume was under a million Today it's at 6.1 
million of trading volume in the last 24 hours It's remarkable the growth that we're seeing 
It's it's really starting to pick up These are individual flyers that I made for the different 
staking periods that you can find in our team telegram Feel free to share those and it 
breaks down some of the math of $100 $1,000 and $10,000 It's past midnight for me and 
so it's definitely past my bedtime but I wanted to get this video out to you so that you can 
have kind of the latest and greatest Um this is the comp plan which is a matching on your 
team's daily earnings starting with 15% direct which is very powerful If you watch this 
video that um Magnus did here he he really does a good job of showing why this ongoing 

slow but consistent um matching versus one time uh like 15% of deposit why the slower 
15% of profits daily is the better outcome and ultimately pays you more Uh he does the 
math on that So uh feel free to watch that Uh and you know 
• deeper We're going to actually I'm going to do a Zoom call with Magnus later this week 
of uh diving deep into the comp plan and the power of comp plan because there's guys in 
Asia that are making,000 2,000 3,000 $5,000 a day But there aren't these kinds of 
numbers in the English market We are the English market It's up to us to decide how big 
we want to grow this into the English market Because guess what How many people have 
you heard bring pop to you That should tell you how much it's been in the shadows and 
how uh big it can be if we get it out there which right now it's getting it's getting out there 
because uh for example I had one of the guys that I was sharing this with for like two 
months but he's been busy doing other things Finally someone else shared it with him and 
he's like "Hey isn't that what you were talking to me about and now now he's like "Okay 
now I got to take a look at this." So here's a quick summary of the major bullet points 
Again you can find find this flyer in our team telegram You can also find this one in our 
team telegram as well I want to show you something This was my total team volume as 
of like yesterday Uh which by the way yesterday someone just dropped in 10,000 
because it was like uh not 422,000 So I was like cool Like they grew by 10,000 And then 
today um unexpectedly it grew again by another 10,000 432,000 And guess what 
Someone I know is in the midst of converting some crypto and they're putting in 10,000 
These are three different people And so things are starting to pick up The word is getting 
out there So let's go ahead and do a withdrawal Right now I'm at $435 a day So look at 
this My my earnings in the pool was,081 and then,08 and then 1,094 because whenever 
you have teammates that join at a particular time it's timestamped and 24 hours from that 
time they get paid and you get the percentage override depending on your rank So we're 
going to refresh this 1,094 and uh,095 So it's growing around the clock With that let's go 
to transfer to asset balance uh maximum here And then we are going to this 10% uh of of 
the conversion withdraw fee So I'm getting $985 in PUSD There it is By the way if you 
want to transfer PUSD to anyone else you can go here and then click transfer 
• pens let me tell you about NX1 to create the account Right now they are not yet on the 
app store and they don't have a desktop version but this is a exchange that you can use 
anywhere around the world without a VPN and minimal to no KYC So the way you get 
this onto your phone there's one way for Androids and then there's another way for iOS 
but the link to download it is in the description of this video So make sure to uh look in 
the description of how to download this Um and if you need any help feel free to reach 
out and I'll guide you through those steps so that you can have this app on your phone 
and you can then guide your teammates to do the same It is very very smooth after you 
get it onto your phone So let's go to withdraw And there we have the $974 in uh USDT 
And then you can choose which chain of USDT that you want to withdraw in Binance 
Smart Chain USDT TRC20 Soul ERC20 We're going to withdraw this in USDT TRC20 
So you can click on that You can also save some wallet addresses in your address book or 
paste a new address to do that Make sure to longhold the wallet address and paste it in 
there So I'm going to paste my wallet address in there and the amount You can select all 
of it and there should be like a $2 fee to do the withdraw Click confirm Now withdraw 
Email verification When you get to this page uh they won't send out an email verification 
unless you actually hit get verification code So click get verification code and then they'll 

email it to you and uh type the verification number into your right there So that's 727162 
727162 and then confirm And then you have a sixdigit uh pin code to input as a security 
feature And then now you can go and see the receipt of your transaction and within a few 
minutes it will land in the wallet of your choice uh in the form of the USDT that you 
wanted So this is a convenient way that you can teach your teammates to convert their 
PPT into USDT completing the whole cycle of starting with USDT into POPMAX 
generating the daily yield uh withdrawing or converting the PUSD into PPT withdrawing 
the PPT from POP into their web3 wallet and then ultimately into an exchange whether 
it's BitGet or Mexi for NX1 which I'm really enjoying the process of and then sending um 
do 
• rger deposits seeing that now with people that have been in for months now are starting to 
refer others Um and again the English market has been very much left behind due to lost

Pop Max | All Time High Price + 2500 PPT Withdraw 
• ht here I'm going to send 2,500 uh which is $375 uh so I'm confirming to send that so 
while that is on the way uh to my Mexi I want to show you something um that is really 
powerful which is not just my cat sleeping here with me but uh what's happening 
internationally with this opportunity and how Global it is I know that we are all behind 
the screen in our different parts of the world so it's very helpful to see the momentum that 
is happening on a global scale because it's not just something that is is is small for uh us 
to not know the big potentials of because where there are communities it's really 
blossoming so take a look at this this is our team Telegram where you can see so many 
activities uh around the world so presentation and so I'll come back in here I just saw that 
I got the email from Mexi that the funds have landed in the Mexi account so let's just go 
ahead and proceed with that because we'll have more time time as we wait so if you go to 
wallet here and then um spot you'll see the balance of what has landed it'll show the 
balance in usdt that doesn't mean that it is it's just showing your total net worth of your 
portfolio in usdt the Holdings right here by the way you can uh click this right here Hide 
small balances so that you can just see uh what you have so I have 2500 PPT uh at $371 
now if I click on this spot and spot that's where I can either Buy buy or sell in order to 
buy I need usdt in my wallet um and and in order to sell I need PPT to sell so here on the 

left hand side you can choose the pair which will be PPT usdt right there and then um on 
the right hand side again right now I'm selling but if you want to buy you need usdt and 
then you'll buy PPT which you need on the staking side you have your staking amount in 
p PPT so I'm going to go to sell and you can type in the amount here or you can slide this 
toggle all the way to the end you can choose limit which you can set a limit price that you 
want to sell or you can sell at the exact market price so I'm going to do that I'm going to 
hit sell PPT and right here it says ordered successfully so there it is uh it's done now we 
can go to wallet we can go to spot and we will see that the balance now is in usdt at $369 
now um I would say giv 
• e it a minute or two before you execute a withdraw because there's something that that is 
updating because otherwise it will show that your balance is zero let me show you what I 
mean so that you don't freak out uh when you try to do this withdrawal so I'm grabbing 
my address of my same wallet which does it doesn't have to be the same wallet it can be 
any wallet um um by the way then you can also convert the usdt into other cryptos here if 
you want but I think most of us like usdt um and then you can choose uh you can paste 
the address and then you can choose the chain uh you can get it in binance smart chain 
Tron chain you'll need a Tron wallet and address there uh you ethereum chain Soul uh 
madic right there for this uh example I'm going to use BMV chain and then if you hit 
select all you'll get this zero incorrect quantity format so don't freak out just give it a 
minute it will just update and with that we can we can go back into uh what I was trying 
to show you on Telegram and we'll come back in a minute to uh do that first major 
International Event happening in maau China on March 25th the requirements of being 
flown there and accommodated are in the team telegram you can look at those for 
yourself uh this is an office for popmax you can see it written on the glass wall uh they 
have meetings and conferences and and and Mastermind I had posted when uh PBT was 
at 13 cents and now it's at 15 cents so much activity so it's just nice to see this and uh here 
is the events so a lot of activities going on around the world uh say hello to my little 
fuzzy friend who just woke up from his or her nap I don't know if it's their nap okay so 
they will just get cozy here uh as I show you the withdraw part because I think now we 
can do the withdrawal in Mexi it has been enough time uh and right there let's go back 
here so uh again I'm going to grab this address and uh let's go ahead and execute that 
withdrawal so paste my address I'll just grab the address again here here here here and 
then select Network binance smart chain and now doing the same thing it's there you see 
so don't freak out you can put a little note of what it is you don't have to do that and then 
my favorite part is the fact that you don't have to do kyc 
Pop Max | Comp Plan Training With CMO 
• nd activity So with that we have an amazing ecosystem on which we can build an 
amazing income And to help us understand the power of the comp plan I'm going to turn 
it over to our wonderful CMO where we can dive into the potentials and examples of 
what is possible here So Magnus thank you for your time Let's dive into what you have 
Thank you so much S And hello to everyone And of course s I have to say we I'm very 
proud to co c co-work with you because you are doing a great great job Your channel is 
very popular and a lot of people follow you and listen to your uh content So that is also 
helping this together uh like as I was saying mostly my job is to interpretate actually I 

will pick the brain of the people behind and try to make it more understandable for us 
because the concept as I was saying is amazing they have so many things in place now 
it's up to us to actually grow our markets which is the western markets English speaking 
markets for example we have a huge potential here so absolutely let's go in and I will 
show you for example the compensation plan because it's very simple even though it 
looks more complicated So just let me see if I can share my screen here and I will try to 
by the way just give you a short examples Yes it's my favorite type of comp plan because 
in other types of comp plan it stops at a certain level and it may be seven levels 10 levels 
15 levels 20 levels whatever it is but it stops With this kind of comp plan which is a uni- 
level differential you are rewarded to the infinite depth of your team based on your rank 
And so it really uh helps capitalize your effort and not get cut off And even when some 
people reach your same rank actually they've solved that problem as well Uh for those 
that reach a certain rank you will forever retain an over override on your team So it's a 
brilliant comp plan Exactly Sam I agree with you and even though it's like I said simply 
we need to make it understandable as well because sometimes you only get everything 
presented in one go people just look at it and say what is this so like you said I usually 
say this is an infinity unile breakaway plan with uh top-notch inside just to talk the first 
one that everyone has all active members meaning you have a 
• sibility and the privilege of being at uh an incredible time at the frontier of taking 
something from the east to the west while seeing the potential being represented and the 
numbers being made because whatever language you speak that is USDT So uh you 
know it's it's a universal amount uh in in terms of numbers So the potential is immense 
I'm grateful to have kind of rediscovered this Um Magnus any closing thoughts about uh 
what people should be doing right now um to to get ahead before it starts to really pick up 
because once people in the English speaking market start breaking the thousand $2,000 
$3,000 a day then it's going to be like what are you doing it's like well I told you about it 
exactly a month ago Uh the same thing So what what can people do now yeah first of all 
just to make a a fact check is that actually I spoke to the company and asking for different 
numbers They say in today's actually 80% of all people that comes into Popmax choosing 
360 days staking period So that also shows something that is actually sustainable is 
growing and is very powerful And back to the question regarding what people should do 
Well it's actually no big science What you need to do is to speak to more people take help 
take advantage of Sal's channel for example There's a lot of good contents in there We 
also do weekly meetings that we trying to emphasize and train people about different 
things But it's all about you This is all up to you what you want to do If you feel wow I 
want to do this I want to go to minimum $1,000 a day Well then you need to start 
working And this is uh there's no easy way to reach the top but it's hard work but I 
guarantee you it's rewarding and you will love it That is one thing certain And of course 
uh as long as companies doing events if you have the chance go there because that's also 
where things happening in the event 80% of your all your time if you spend that on 
events or promoting events for example your results will be an amazing thing because 
yeah events is where magic happens that is very closing statement on that part Yeah well 
said Magnus and thank you for your time and wisdom Uh I can tell you this that I love 
waking up and looking at my back office seeing how the numbers from ye 
• sterday's changed to today Whether it's the daily earnings um whether it's the um uh total 
team volume whether it's the number of people It's just a wonderful part of the day And I 

spend the rest of the day trying to figure out how can I get this to more people And I 
think that right now whether regardless of where they start just getting people involved 
uh getting them in the system and allowing them to try it out even for $100 will get them 
rolling into oh okay this is what the platform is this is what I earn this is what I can 
convert oh there's other things and let them you know get in where they fit in after that 
but just get as many people onto your team because as it blossoms as PPT may grow in 
terms of price as uh other other exciting things happen they're already positioned with 
then they'll come back and say "Oh okay I need to I need to 10x this I I was already in I 
was sleeping on this project Now I I can really excel." So thank you We look forward to 
having a lot more of these uh conversations with Magnus that are extremely helpful I was 
telling him it's because of someone like him that's bridging the field to the company that 
we now have a good representation of understanding and being able to kind of know 
what's happening with the company and uh he's been a wonderful um liaison that's 
allowing us to really excel And now I feel more confident than ever to put in the work 
here to be an example for many of what is possible here and I think we need the Roger 
Banister type of effect of seeing someone break the $1,000 a day in the English speaking 
market And that whether you know I it's it's may not benefit you directly if for example I 
or Magnus did it but having someone that has done it and being able to use that person as 
a reference and to bring your people to that person to say look at that person let's hear 
from him let's let's see that he has done it and that will open up people's mind to say okay 
it's worth the effort effort here because I know someone is making And again because we 
don't have that in the English speaking market it is up to us to create those stories So 
thank you again Magnus and we'll catch you guys on these continuous weekly updates uh 
that Magnus does and I'll continue to uh

• always going to be $90 or in this case per hundred dollar of PPT at whatever market 
value so I'm going to slide this and it's going to convert the P USD into PPT now when I 
go to assets it still says 90 but that 90 is not in the form of PD it's in the form of PPT 
which exists outside of the ecosystem I just have to get it to my bitg wallet how do I do 
that well PPT is not listed here until I import that token by clicking this little plus button 
and then pasting the uh contract address which you can uh find and I'll I'll put it in the 
description of this video as well and I'll put it in our team telegram as well so now it's 
been added and then you can uh see that it is somewhere down here maybe right there it's 
right there but the balance is zero until I execute the withdraw which I'm about to do right 
now maximum of 744 ppts so slide that over and then just confirm the transaction oh wait 
I need I need B uh BNB actually that's a very good point so I actually used my BNB uh 
to help someone else um so now I need B&B here so I'm going to transfer some BNB 
from one wallet to another wallet so I will just um that's a really good point so if you 
have opened up a brand new wallet you'll make sure to get some BNB there so I'm going 
to transfer from my metamask to over there uh let's just oh okay I'm going to switch that 
to let's say $5 send confirm so you need that uh BNB as uh gas fee because it's on the 
BSC Network so when the BNB lands here then we're going to be able to proceed with 
the transaction and then we're going to uh import the or when we do the withdrawal for 
PBT it will land in what we've already uh imported the token address here and that is uh 

what what gives us the freedom to then go ahead to those major exchanges such as bybit 
bitg Mexi gate Isle and others that uh are coming to the market that you can sell that on 
including panc pancake Swap and from that you have the freedom to either hold PPT uh 
either in your you know decentralized wallet or anywhere that you can hold PPT or you 
can right there so it just landed right there now we're going to uh do the withdrawal again 
and confirm okay and now now give it a minute or so as it as as it will get processed to 
um right there so the withdraw has been s

• different social media why it's interesting why people who are on Facebook Instagram 
Tik Tok would diversify into it what is their benefit what is the key features some of the 
highlights are that it has AI it has web 3 it has social F uh uh social Finance um 
embedded into it so those are some of the key aspects uh that that that this platform has 
and um right here I like no not this one right here I like the comparison chart that they 
have uh what does pop social have it has targeted audience uh it has user ownership oh 
um Angel uh is here it has uh social portability it has multiple chains nft ecosystem native 
token gameification reward develop or um platform as well as based protocol so a lot 
more to dive into there is a white paper that you can jump into and read all of that um 
which the aim by the CEO uh of of Pop social says we aim to decentralize the world's 
creativity the same way that ethereum decentralized the internet and that is Michael Shen 
there the CEO and this is his LinkedIn and uh this pop social LinkedIn so with that we 
have our wonderful CMO with us um and I will make her co-host and we also did 
another Zoom call which you can find on our team YouTube channel as well as in our 
team telegram um where you can uh view that recording uh which was um uh covering 
uh the the pop social side but this one we're going to be able to uh hear from her 
specifically about um the latest and greatest and at the end you can ask your own 
questions about the pop social side so with that um and are you able to hear oh there she 
is okay there you there you go wonderful thank you for guys lovely to have you here with 
us yours thank you so much for inviting me here uh first of all a big hello from my side 
good evening good morning from whever you are tuning us tuning in uh I'm so very 
excited to introduce you to pop social tell you about our team and what we are doing so 
let's start this so let me share my screen with you people uh yeah awesome awesome I 
love her energy and her enthusiasm and her knowledge about this platform so looking 
forward for you guys to meet her and and learn from her as well okay so um so we are 
talking about the internet's greatest Obsession that is social media you know social media 
is som 
• d share which Facebook doesn't um you know Instagram doesn't and unless you're a big 
content theator uh you have that much of a incentive to to drive people to a social media 
platform um and I agree with some of the comments of of Having learned a lot more 
through your presentation of why um we're we're we're doing this and the space and the 
timing that we're in to be able to uh capitalize on this uh Facebook restricts me from 
monetizing my account because of uh the of fact Checkers not going to happen in pop 
social yeah it's a lot of those limitations that gets uh uplifted and and then you really feel 
your wings are able to spread and explore the true potential of a social media platform 
that gives you a lot more freedom and rights and control and um and and that's something 

that being confined in these very rigid platforms where we're not empowered um where 
we can be silenced at any moment um you know it's really nice to go into something that 
uh doesn't have those those vulnerabilities and those points of failures and if you see we 
are even giving you freedom from censorship you know the the Instagram or the other 
platforms that we use they just remove your content they just uh remove your content uh 
thinking I mean you don't know the reason they don't tell you that what is the reason they 
just say you you have exploited the the guidelines and we are removing it but with us you 
are getting full freedom from the censorship that's that's I think people will appreciate 
those kinds of um additional values right now I'm just doing the uh random number 
generator because of our raffle giveaways that we do uh so um the winning number for 
today was 419 and my team is already uh used to dropping a number in the chat so now 
we just have to find that why they're dropping the numbers and now oh yeah yeah yeah 
so I I I raffle away 300 ppts on each one of our Zoom calls so that's for three winners 100 
PPT each so um now now we just have to find whoever the three closest are uh I'll I'll 
leave that up to you guys in the chat to find uh that I don't know if pepper is here with us 
on the zoom to find it for us but I'm here I'm checking she's checking okay so no worries 
but as as we're doing that hopefully this Zoom gave you a 
Pop Max | Easy Step To Swap PPT To USDT 
• hey hey PopMax tribe you know it's serious when you put on the blue light blockers 
because I've been working into the night getting things going and boy has this sleeping 
giant been waking up this opportunity that we have been in but not really understanding 
the full gravity of it just to put things into perspective there are people in Asia making 
1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 plus dollars not per month not per week per day per day so 
there isn't any of those stories in the English-speaking market there are in Southeast Asia 
like Vietnam China South Korea uh those kind of places but where is the rest of the 
world where is our communities this is our opportunity to get into the game and start 
bringing our audience to be able to earn at some scale of those kind of numbers now there 
has been some things that have made it easier for our teams to start now engaging on a 
mass scale level you see to be able to earn in this web 3 AI social media platform that 
pays you to do what you're already doing on Facebook Tik Tok Instagram uh all these 
other social platforms which is launching soon um in order to onboard into that 
ecosystem where you can earn point4 to 1% a day 7 days a week 12 to 30% a month you 
can sell that appreciating token anytime and start as low as $100 starting today and 
getting paid tomorrow you would need to go to any of these exchanges where their native 
token is listed and you would need to buy half your deposit amount in the form of their 
native token called PPT so that was kind of a friction point of many people not knowing 
where to buy it not knowing the steps or it was like you had to hop on Zoom to help your 
teammate to do that now that has been alleviated actually uh so now we can dive into 
these numbers of the different staking periods um which you can now do with 100% 
USDT beep 20 which is on the Binance Smart Chain so if you have $100 there you can 
simply deposit the full 100 no longer needing 50 in USDT Binance Smart Chain and 50 
in PPT then you can start staking and start earning now on the back end you would be 
getting paid uh in the what you ultimately withdraw is their native token called PBT 

which you would then need to go back to these exchanges where it's listed and sell them 
so whic 
• h is you know more steps uh which I have made a video uh talking about how to sell that 
on the NX1 exchange um if you need help setting that up reach out to your sponsor uh or 
or or me and um on on how to get that onto your phone as they're working on the desktop 
version so that is another point of okay well what do I do with PBT well you know you 
have to go through the steps of selling it something interesting has happened that I could 
not believe at first which is uh someone uh I was just checking up with him i was like 
"Hey uh are you are you uh selling your PPT do you need any help selling it let me know 
uh if you need help because uh you may not know where to sell it." So I reached out to 
him he's like "No I sold it." And I was like "Where did you sell it?" He's like "Um on uh I 
just did a swap on uh MetaMask." And I was like "But you you can't do that like you 
have to go to an exchange i mean like they don't even do that." So I was like "Send me 
some screenshots let me let me see what you're doing." And um he was very adamant i 
was like "No no you must have done something wrong this doesn't you can't do that like 
that's it's not even how would how would MetaMask even have you know uh like it's not 
listed there." So it was like you know it it was weird i I didn't understand it but then I 
tried it and it worked and so that's what we're going to try here together so uh welcome to 
my back office where now I'm averaging $438 oh I got to sign in $438 a day which if we 
do the math on that $438 that's over $3,000 a week which that is a good starting point but 
guess what that can be brought to 6 days 5 days 4 days 3 days 2 days one day and that's 
what I'm aiming for so anyway I have $379 that I can withdraw so I'm going to go ahead 
and transfer to asset balance maximum there's a 10% conversion withdraw uh burning 
stuff there and then uh it's in the form of PUSD i'm going to convert that PUSD into PPT 
i'm getting 1626 PPT great and now I'm going to go here and I'm going to withdraw this 
$314 in the form of PPT um you know it's it's it's what I like about this platform is that 
regardless of the price fluctuation of the token on the market you are getting paid we are 
getting paid in stable coin which is PUSD which is 
• f input USDT output USDT you know then people will be like okay now I understand oh 
now there's an exchange uh I I can save on fees by doing it on the exchange while this is 
and remember I had no USDT so um if if USDT comes here oh it did right there right 
there usdt it just came from that swapping so you can see you can do it on BitGet uh and 
now we're going to try it on um uh MetaMask so I'm going to actually send some funds 
like let's say 100 uh I have uh zero PPT here so I'm going to send 100 uh PPT uh there 
and 100 here and then do the same thing on MetaMask as I know a lot of people are used 
to using MetaMask uh so you can do it in both places so uh again I have right here I do 
have I do have some Tether here because I did it earlier today so I have $8.55 of Tether 
remember that and now we're going to do the swap of PPT right here to what usdt you 
can also do it to BNB if you need some BNB in your uh I'm going to do the max 100 and 
it's now searching fetching we are good to swap and here we go and uh it's doing the little 
swapping thing submit close okay so the little progress bar and it swap is complete close 
and remember it was $8 and now it's $28 of USDT so quite remarkable that this is even 
possible i did not know that until literally today and I wanted to get that out to you guys 
so that you can easily help your teammates convert and then of course in the future teach 
them the the exchange method but that's really really cool i want to also show you 
something very interesting which is numbers of growth it is remarkable what's happening 

here uh the day before yesterday um my our team balance was 422,000 okay yesterday it 
was 432,000 grew by 10,000 today it's 446,000 which is like 14,000 more so in numbers 
not in words not in you know me saying oh good things are happening in numbers you 
can see that the team is growing money is starting to some good money some serious 
money some even bigger clients that are in the works of like 20K plus kind of clients are 
are in the works of u coming on board with POP because I think over time POP has 
proven like okay there there's substance here it's not just a staking model without any like 
backend infrastructure the fact that a they're listed on top tier three of

• first of all uh nice to be back i know last week we had um a travel coming up a little bit 
intensive so we could not be part of that uh leadership call but this week we are back 
home it was a two-day trip to uh Dubai and from uh Canada to the Dubai you should 
know there's one way 13 hours trip so that was really really hectic but it went good and 
we are back now home and we're gonna continue this week's leadership call all right I 
think we are ready to rock and roll and this week I want to present to you the big picture 
of PopMax Pop Social and everything around our glorious ecosystem all right let me 
move on to the first slide and we start by talking about Pop Social which is the core of 
everything now Popo is an AIdriven reward-based web tree version of Tik Tok plus 
Telegram the social platform where engagement earns rewards and this is why this has 
become so much more popular than anything else and the reason is many but Pop Social 
is a global creative creator economy engine powered by AI and built on web 3 bridging 
Tik Tok style content with Telegram style communities and aiming to build a 
decentralized traffic empire for everyone and today around 4.5 billion people use social 
platforms they're spending an average of 2.5 hours every day but how many are actually 
making money from it That is not many people I can tell you because we all know that 
Tik Tok Facebook Instagram and all these they don't pay you anything to be there right 
but we're creating a lot of value to them so Pop Social is about turn every voice into an 
asset and reconstruct the power structure of social media which is of course powerful 
words but how we do that let me show you First let's talk about facts and statistics i see 
that my here I need to take away now i hope no one this gets disturbed all right so facts 
and statistics let's talk about Tik Tok all right tik Tok generated an estimated 23 billion 
revenue in 2024 and how they did that well 77% of percent of its revenue came from 
advertising but 23% coming from Tik Tok shops and that's astonishing 5.3 billion in in 
revenue and you have to remember they charge 0.6% transaction fees and then still made 
5.3 billion in revenue tik Tok uh shops has become very very powerful i mean this is

Pop Max | FREE Trip To South Korea Event 🇰🇷 
• hey there PopMax tribe back with the latest and greatest to help us maximize PopMax for 
those of you guys that have been following along our journey from the beginning or 
you're just new to our tribe you can still look back at the journey from our past YouTube 
videos as well as posts made in our Telegram channel and Facebook group you may have 
noticed that in the past few weeks things have been growing exponentially and I'll share 
with you the open secret of exactly how that has been happening and what was a turning 
point in this sleeping giant of a hidden gem of an opportunity With that being said prior 
to the first PopMax event which happened in Vietnam my first time in Vietnam as well I 
was making about $20 and something dollars per day and then by attending that event 
things began to change astronomically You see in the past few days I have now crossed 
$52 the day after that crossed $528 the day after that crossed $563 By the way these are 
results that I'm posting on social media on a daily basis as well as in our team channels so 
feel free to use that to post as well as you can say someone on the team is making this 
kind of money but the reason why this has been happening is by immersing myself in that 
Vietnam event by being at the grounds of understanding the larger ecosystem of what 
was happening I got a bigger picture of that understanding that I was missing such as I 
didn't know when going to the event that uh I was going to be on stage but they needed a 
representative from the English markets and guess what i was I was the guy and so 
they're like uh could you get up there and say some things about your journey and there is 
me so uh not only did I get to learn a lot from these international leaders by which by the 
way they're making thousands of dollars per day but moreover I got a chance to put 
myself in a place of authority in a place of being on stage and so the reason I say this to 
you is because the next event is right around the corner it is not in Vietnam it is in South 
Korea on Guju Island the dates are June 4th to June 7th and these are the requirements to 
being fully compensated from flights to hotels to activities to inclusive everything you 
can either achieve this by 50,000 in personal dire 
• ke business and vacation together hanging out with friends making money and of course 
making content there of showing your team that you're there which drives a lot more 
credibility which drives a lot more actions which drives a lot more volume that is the 
hidden gem of growing your team is by putting yourself in a place of authority of taking 
the action of taking the leap of taking the leadership to go and be there assessing it for 
yourself and making the content being the eyes and ears for your leaders that cannot 
make it there that is what's going to change the game and that's what I pride myself on 
doing that's why I'm all over the world is I try to be present the physical embodiment of 
as many of us that need the information and I go there with my little camera setup and 
things which by the way from the Vietnam event I had my tripod and I recorded uh a lot 
of videos that now you see on our team channel so that was you know thanks to me being 
there that I got those uh content for those of us that couldn't attend uh so it was very 
helpful both from my understanding and our team growth so imagine what it can do for 
you can completely change the trajectory of not just your PopMax journey but you as a 
team builder you as a leader in the industry It can change all of that by being in those 
environments where you can connect with other top-notch individuals from around the 
world and that's how you begin to create friendships and relationships and and and and 
teams around the world because you are are in those kind of environments in those kind 

of rooms in those kind of conversations and again this is fully compensated so it's not like 
you're paying extra for anything you're making the deposit in your account you're making 
let's say on the $10,000 at 1% a day an extra $100 a day and you also qualify for that full 
accommodations stuff so I think it's a wonderful win and a great driver for those $10,000 
deposits because even if you can't there's people you know that may be able to do that 
and they'll a add more volume to your team b they will make a lot of money c they will 
get to go d they will come back with enthusiasm and fire which will fire up your team so 
a lot of strategy there make the effort the final calcu

on this particular uh brief demonstration of how to onboard yourself how to get involved 
in this opportunity how to start earning on a daily basis so that you are able to you know 
start realizing the yield and start collecting PP One area that we haven't really explored is 
just holding PPT for the value of that to increase as there's a lot of uh potential there but 
you can decide what you want to do you know liquidate half hold half liquidate all uh 
completely up to you I love the freedom of of the range of options so hop on to our daily

Pop Max | Marketing Content & Japan Event 

• hey there PopMax tribe wanted to make you a quick update video in my really cool and I 
gotta say quite high quality pop shirt i wish I had a pop hat which I might have to make 
of my own that's not a bad idea okay you know what uh I'll get on that or my secretary 
will i wanted to show you guys this really cool flyer that I got from the Vietnamese event 
that happened just a few weeks back i'll take a high resolution picture of it and share it in 
our team telegram also there's a really cool event happening in Tokyo which I was almost 
maybe thinking about going there but I will be going to Japan for a different reason later 
next week uh which is going to be a first time country number 36 for me but I wanted to 
share the these pictures and read some of the very interesting things that I'm discovering 
about how big this ecosystem is uh for example right here where it says uh pop social uh 
wait right there right there right there um I I've already posted these in the team telegram 
so you guys can uh peruse it yourself but in case you don't um let me just share this with 
you right here pop Social is a social finance platform that seamlessly combines web 3 and 
AI to create a decentralized user first digital social ecosystem by leveraging blockchain 
and artificial intelligence we're redefining the creator economy and breaking free from 
the limitations of traditional platforms our goal is to empower every user to control their 
social identity and create creative journey in an open transparent and innovative 
environment how cool of a mission statement is that also here you see the ecosystems 
unlimited potential just some of their ecosystem you have PopMax a groundbreaking 
fund that propels economic model to new heights punkverse pop ecosystemdriven 
physical entities now listed on NASDAQ which is the US stock market pop uh X a fresh 
incubation fund designed to cultivate thriving ecosystem projects pop chain completing 
the full integration of the POP ecosystem driving PPT's growth so really cool there and 
then you have the um the POP uh right there global social hub expanding the pop 
ecosystem even further um the the world's first trendy toy web 3 financial economic 
model uh ecosystem which you can actually read what punk ve 
• rse is over there and then NX1 which is a partnered exchange with POP's ecosystem oh 
oh this is the flyer wait is that the same flyer it is the same flyer oh okay okay cool cool 
so um that's cool uh I I I wish I could get this into the hands of each and every one of you 
guys because it is a really cool very informative flyer um so man man I should have been 
there in Japan this looks Yeah that's the flyer that's the flyer okay that's uh Okay cool 
cool so take a look at these uh content yourself you know it's really nice to see um not 
just the live uh interaction of our online platforms but this was a part of a bigger 
conference where POP was one of the guest um sponsors and and um part of a much 
bigger like web 3 uh conference so that's really really impressive uh not just that but take 
a look at just the fact that we're listed again is a huge selling point for those that are 
taking a fresh look at this opportunity it's like hey what makes your passive opportunity 
different it's listed on tier one exchanges two of these exchanges are amongst the top 10 
exchanges and guess what they're working on Binance so do you want to wait until they 
get to Binance and then you're going to be behind or or do you want to get ahead of it like 
me and the other teammates are so I created these flyers which you can also find in our 
team telegram um easy to share on social media easy to post 10day staking opportunity 
get principal back after 10 days minimum $100 earn point4% a daily 12% a month 
withdraw profits daily 4% plus principal back and there's an example of a $100 $1,000 
and $10,000 deposit and the yields across those 10 days and then you have uh this right 
here the 30 days same concept just the math on the 30-day which is 0.5% daily and then 

the same for the 90-day staking 6% daily same for the 180day staking 8% daily and then 
we have the 360day most popular earn 1% daily and the mathematics on that uh also I've 
created this right here which summarizes u the concept web 3 AI social media platform 
that pays you to like comment and engage launching soon perhaps at the event uh in 
South Korea at the end of May um which you can actually go there um the qualifications 
will be released earn point4 to 1% daily 7 days a week 12% t 
• o 30% monthly sell appreciating token anytime that's the PBT start for $100 uh start 
today earn tomorrow already listed on these major exchanges and then um also we have 
this flyer which I really like it has a lot of the uh information of people that just want to 
know the numbers what's in it for me what can I earn what do I need to do all of that 
detail is right there and the possibilities they can instantly understand at a glance so very 
sharable piece of uh content here uh that you can easily post and pass around let's do a 
quick withdraw uh I have about 280 right there and again uh if you leave your PPT or 
your earnings there it in PUSD right there in the pool balance it earns you more income 
as PUSD gets into the pool from that 10% uh conversion fee or withdraw fee which I'm 
about to pay right now so this right here as I'm taking this out this fee of 10% 50% of that 
goes to the the pool of PUSD that pays out um the the uh 6 to 1.3% on your profits so 
you're making profits on profits uh that's really impressive and a hidden gem of this 
opportunity now I'm going to convert the B by the way by the way uh in case I didn't 
mention this on a recorded Zoom call um you can make now a deposit in as as a staking 
without having to withdraw the money into your wallet essentially you can compound 
without needing to do a full withdraw and restaking the way to do that uh is that you 
would need to initiate that first step and get PUSD and then as you'll see here you can 
change the USDT um to this rate oh that's the event in South Korea to PUSD and look it's 
registering that I have 252 PUSD now I need to pair that with PPT that I have inside of 
my back office which I don't have any PPT well I can take half of the 2527 wait wait 
what is that 25 yeah uh $126 I think um and then I can swap that instead of doing max 
here we would just do half of it and then you would have some PPT here and then you 
can actually do the full staking from the internal earnings that you have in there so 
essentially we have three ways of staking one is um the normal uh the normal USDT with 
PPT secondly is just USDT if you click auto proportioning and then finally you have the 
PUSD and internal PPT here we're going to do a full withdrawal so I'm goi 
• ng to do the swapping of a 100% just to show that and also I have to pay out some 
winnings of people from some giveaways that I'm doing on our Facebook group You can 
find the link to that in the description below of uh whether you post some things whether 
you post your results oh I got to sign in um into our Facebook group or post some of 
those flyers on your social media and share the link um yeah so so I'm incentivizing some 
ways that you can earn yourself some free PPT including your teammates because this 
opportunity deserves to get out there so now uh when you get back here it may still show 
the funds don't freak out don't get too excited uh it just um hasn't been sent yet okay so 
right here let's go to my wallet where I have zero PPTs and that should bump up to the 
one that I withdrew so in essence hopefully you guys see that there's a lot of activities 
happening both online offline we have daily or we have by the way speaking of daily um 
one of the best resources that we have right now is uh and this right here 1232 it landed 
right there as it does um this Zoom call that I did with the CMO of POP uh Max very 
powerful he is uh a great leader who's done massive things um and it was a very strategic 

uh helpful overview that I learned a lot from so if you want to share the opportunity that 
first is the some of the infographics of like this or this or this or this or this or this or this 
um and then once once they are curious and they ask for more information send them this 
video and then then they can uh you know sign up with your link this one was also a 
great one that I really liked learning about the pop ecosystem on the social media side and 
then this one was the uh weekly update uh from Magnus that about the latest and greatest 
also very helpful so get your info together this has the opportunity to completely change 
our lives whatever you're making right now in pop 10x it 10x it to know what is possible 
here and would that change your life being able to earn that on a daily basis if the answer 
to that is yes then what's going to take you from where you are to that 10X is just getting 
this out there just sharing and delivering the the already produced content the flyers the 
video that I did with Magnus a 
Pop Max | New Feature! Stake USDT Only          
• ll still show the balance once you refresh you'll see that it has uh actually left and and is 
on the way to is on the way to the wallet and there it is 1737 it has hit our wallet there 
now I'm going to go to Mexi which is where I like to do my conversion i'm going to make 
a deposit of PPT and send this amount all $4327ish and that is on the way to Mexi uh for 
it to then be converted but in summary we have an opportunity that pays us uh each and 
every day and not only pays us this 1% uh up to um per day but also if you wanted to you 
can hold the PPT and sell it at your own pace um meaning you can look at the market and 
see when you want to sell it based on uh if if it's at a lower point you may not want to sell 
it at that time and once it increases you can sell at that meaning you can extract more 
value from your earnings by looking at the charts and and seeing when to hold PBT when 
to sell PBT but of course in the longer span of of of the time frame it's done quite well it's 
done you know at least from even when I joined it's done 300% and that was two months 
ago so that's pretty it's pretty good uh let's go to see if it has landed here in the Mexi back 
office not yet so once it Oh by the way uh in our team telegram I'll upload a lot of other 
videos from the event so if you wanted to see what happened there as well as uh our 
CMO for Pop Social Angelie did a great uh like onstage presentation of the bigger 
ecosystem and so I got the email from Mexi saying that it landed so right here we'll see 
$428 then I'm going to go to spot spot and sell it on the open market i literally have to be 
out of this hotel room in 28 minutes and get into a car for like a long three-hour drive to 
the airport so uh change this to it's already for me PPT but if you if it says uh something 
else change that to PPTUSDT so on that pair you want to sell and you can either type in 
the amount or you can slide this toggle here and you want to sell at the current market 
price sell and just like that it's been sold and uh now you can go to wallet and you can go 
to spot so whereas the balance was in PPT now the balance is in um right here it's in uh 
USDC I still have 17 PPT so I can actually sell that as well so I'll go to spot spot uh sell 
and m 
• arket value maybe right here right there sell and that's also sold so now all my balance 
should be in PP uh in USDT right there and now I can go to wallet and withdraw and for 
that you'll need uh most likely we're going to withdraw in USDT you have to decide 
which chain of USDT you wanted the funds in i'm going to do back to my uh wallet here 
so I'm going to do um rece or this is the wallet actually but uh it's the same address right 

here um ending in F8 so I'm going to paste that here it should automatically um well I 
guess I could select different networks but I'm going to do Binance Smart Chain and then 
you can select all here now if you see this don't freak out that just means you're doing the 
withdrawal very fast uh just give it another minute and it will populate so we're just going 
to refresh and do it again in about a minute's time u but this is the POP the introduction to 
the POP ecosystem uh really it has a lot more layers to it a lot bigger than I thought it was 
um it has a lot of different um elements to it not just the staking alone so uh it it's really 
prevalent in Asia and I think that's because of a language barrier that's because of their 
focus has been predominantly uh Asian market um and so because of not knowing what it 
is that we have our hands on we are uh I really like this picture um we we're missing out 
on on understanding the big scope of what this is um so like like this right here you know 
like the board yacht club I it was unknown until it became really big and and it's 
something like this uh where it's like okay what exactly is this and then it becomes uh 
really uh viral and interesting and and you know like what if PPT gets to some substantial 
amount and uh which already it's it's done you know decent enough 300% in two months 
is quite wild okay so here Binance Smart Chain select all submit you don't have to do 
KYC and uh and then it will send me an email with a code you have to click get get code 
actually right And uh there it is there's my code 0937 68 and then Google authenticator 
840 9992 and it is on the way You can track the order here This is uh what I just 
requested from the Mexi uh pending progress of $418 before that I did $331 that process 
successfully uh $318 here uh $ 
• 225 here $411 here and uh that's just a few of them if we go to even earlier let's go back 
here here oh that's years oh my gosh oh my gosh okay uh Febru Okay right here february 
we start here okay so I did uh 418 these numbers uh 411 6 and 21 422 395 231 414 and 
so on and so on uh 20 2011 198 379 58 8,116 um 100 uh all of these 1500 uh 158 and so 
many more so many more and so just goes to show uh the flow of the funds is quite 
liquid and there it is 418 just landed into my BitGet wallet uh there it is right there 418 so 
you saw the whole conversion of a withdrawal to my uh bitget uh and then I sent it to an 
exchange like Mexi doesn't have to be Mexi it can be any of these exchanges by bit uh 
gate.io all those uh there that you can convert it on but there you go you saw a summary 
of uh some of the details of the event a lot more of the actual content to be uploaded onto 
uh YouTube and and shared on Facebook and Telegram but uh may want to pay attention 
to this platform uh more so because it is it is uh like I said bigger than I thought and 
bigger than we know um a lot more to discover about it and uh there will be a lot more 
zooms with many different uh individuals from the company side um from the CMO to 
uh of of Pop Social again to CMO of PopMax and uh many other uh top leaders and um 
information from the company side to help us understand where this is headed and it 
seems to be a growing direction so grateful to be a part of it grateful to have been invited 
to Vietnam and gotten the chance to talk on stage which if you want to see a clip of that 
it's already on YouTube um which was quite an experience to speak in front of people 
that didn't even know English uh enough so first time doing that but uh grateful for all of 
it with that guys we'll catch you on our continued growth to make the most to gift back 
the most i will catch you next time for wherever else around the world peace 
Pop Max | Ruben Mata Speech @ Vietnam Event 

• how many of you would like to make a lot more money in your life how about a lot more 
happiness in your life how about a lot more of both in your life yeah well you're in the 
perfect place as we shared earlier today with all the information being shared it has been 
an opportunity for you to take advantage of so how many of you are going to take 
advantage of the opportunity with what we have here today to have more success by a 
show of hands thank you well my name is Ruben Martha i'm an international speaker 
trader and published author and today we'll be sharing some information on how the 
NFTts are emerging and evolutionizing in the world of DeFi one more time so as we 
shared I do trainings all over the world on personal development i do trainings with 
Robert Kiosaki the rich dad poor dad are you familiar with him yes okay i do trainings 
with him we do trainings all over the world in regards to mindset development because as 
you understand when you have an opportunity that's great but what's most important is 
having the correct mindset would you agree yes so that's what we're bringing here is the 
correct mindset with the opportunity with pop social now as this is in with Harve T Harve 
this was in Brazil we had 2,000 people there and also this is what we're going to be 
discussing because the time is brief i only have a short minutes of time so we're going to 
take advantage of that minute so how NFTTS are being shaping the future of the 
decentralized finance it's amazing how the market is changing how when it first started 
out it was in the early days of NFTTS in 2017 when all this came out about NFTTS it's 
like what is it i don't know right we had that understanding of I I don't know we got to 
find out more but it started with the crypto punks and the cryptokitties some amazing 
information and also the introduction of all what we know now is the theory of ERC 721 
standard and digital assets but how many of you after you heard this about NFTTS there 
was a little frustration sat in or you felt like this or we didn't know it's like I don't know i 
don't know but it's okay that's why we're here to guide you in information that you don't 
know for you to have more success or was it like this right frustration what ended up you 
wanting to do this like get away from it right i don't care i don't want to know but the 
great thing is you're here and you have the opportunity to take advantage of it so the 
mainstream adaption to the market it's the rise of the marketplace like the OpenC and 
Rarable Foundation and here's the great thing about what's going on when the celebrities 
got involved when all of a sudden these musicians and the artists started utilizing and 
leveraging the NFTTS so there's opportunity there for you to see where else is going and 
also the NFT backloss this is where we're going with this as far as more information for 
you to have that you came here invested your time you're investing your time now to be 
here because the information that you're going to take away when you go outside those 
doors you apply that information and you'll be able to have more success so here we go 
the fractionalized NFTts for shared ownership the NFT staking for earn rewards and also 
here we have the innovation in utilities the crosschain interoperability and the broader 
usage which means more opportunity now some of you already may know this 
information we understand that but we're going over it once again because the repetition 
creates mastery the more you practice something the more you tend to do it when you 
like it and when you're generating a lot of money from doing it you tend to like it so that's 
where we're going with this and the challenges and risk which all investments have risk 
we understand that but the goal is to minimize the risk when you invest your money 
because the market volatility and the speculative nature and the uncertainty of what we're 
doing is like I shared with the resists and also the security concerns because there's a lot 

of things going on there's a lot of people that are getting involved with your with with 
your accounts and things like that that were taking ownership as far as seeing and 
minimizing the fraud as far as your ability to be exposed but here we have special 
systems that will handle that as well and in conclusion because I have short period of 
time is the NFTs are moving beyond collectibles into functional financial assets that will 
allow you to leverage even in more industries than there already are now and the role in 
DeFi is growing through loans staking governance and tokenized and world assets so 
with that and yes you leave and you feel a lot lighter because you have an understanding 
of what was shared today how you're going to apply it like I share once again in your life 
this is what you're going to feel like there you go so say pop social pop social there you 
go thank you very much and enjoy all your success our time 
Pop Max | South Korea Form Tutorial 🇰🇷 
• hey there PopMax leadership i wanted to make those of you guys that have qualified for 
the second international PopMax event this one happening in Guju Island in South Korea 
should be a spectacular event with over 700 people i was fortunate enough to attend the 
very first one in Vietnam about less than two months ago where I got this cool shirt and 
some amazing footages of that experience captured and shared with you guys on our 
Facebook as well as team as you can see um it it gave me a really rich understanding of 
the possibilities here and the big ocean of markets that are untapped including giving me 
a better understanding of the ecosystem that is here it was somewhat of a sleeping giant 
for the rest of us in the non-Asian markets um until that event and from the content of 
that event that I captured witnessed as well as uh you know communicated um from there 
to the rest of the team has led to an explosion of our growth in our teams um and I think 
the numbers are evident as uh most likely tomorrow I'll be crossing $700 per day now the 
uh qualifications uh were amongst these three options here to get yourself free flights and 
accommodations which are that you need to um either stake $10,000 or have a certain 
amount of team volume um I think it's right here yeah there it is um achieve $50 to 
$100,000 in new personal community performance uh starting from April that was April 
20th I think you could stake $10,000 yourself in the 180day or 360day time frame or you 
can do total team performance whereas number one is direct this is more of a total team 
um and uh that's on your lesser leg needing 150,000 in total team volume would get you 
uh that accommodations for you now if you've met those qualifications then there is a 
link this one right here which I will also put in the description of this video as well as it's 
already in our team telegram um go ahead and fill this out now initially when you click 
on it you'll see some uh not so English characters um you can still try to proceed with you 
know with with what you see there or if you're on your computer you can rightclick and 
translate to English and some of that will be then converted into English so team name 
um I believe we belong in the ACCE international all 
• his month essentially within two days uh no registration accepted after this date for 
inquiries contact official support which is 999 the number99 the number99 on Telegram 
um so again PopMax it should say South Korea but it says just Korea Summit i guess it's 
evident that it's south not North uh registration now open date June 4th to June 7th 
location Guju Island South Korea there it is um global pop ecosystem pioneers will 
gather in Guju for a groundbreaking AI web plus web 3 event oh man that's exciting can't 

wait to see because because we learn so much we get to mastermind with the master 
distributor Magnus is going to be there this is going to cause a huge growth of of um our 
our team uh after this event um being there in person will definitely do a lot for your 
understanding and your impact with your team registration is now open limited spots 
available i think there's going to be like 6 to 700 people maybe possibly more registration 
details eligibility confirm with your team leader whether you meet the uh meet the 
participation criteria deposit some a 1,000 PPT deposit full refund within 3 days after the 
event that that 1,000 PPT you're going to get that back after you attend the event within 3 
days which is by the way like $2 like 6070 right now based on PPT price note if you 
cancel your uh for any personal reason the deposit will not be refunded which is you 
know it's fair in terms of the what the company's paying for and whatnot so it's a small 
little deposit there so uh there's various links uh to different languages of course we're 
doing the English one and again the deadline stuff like that so um let's get this done uh 
whether you qualify whether someone on your team qualifies whether you qualify and 
you can't go you can give that seat to someone else um the difference is they would fill 
out all the information there and where it says the wallet qualification um that that would 
be just your wallet there instead of their wallet so like right here where it says uh 
platform wallet address audit performance that would be your wallet that you're giving to 
one of your leaders that would be able to go and the rest of the information would be 
theirs and then either they or you would send the uh 1,000 PPT he 
• re and then the wallet address where that 1,00 PPT is to be returned right there if you 
need any help with any of these steps you can reach out to this guy right here and uh he 
should help you out to get this up and completed and submitted within the next 36 hours 
or so so we have to take action on this immediately for those that qualify and again if you 
qualify and you can't go figure out a way to get one of your teammates that could be a 
representative for you and your team to go on your behalf don't waste that seat um it 
could be transformational for that person which happens to be on your team and thus 
transformational for you as well and you have some eyes and ears on the ground that you 
can communicate with this is a great strategy if by chance you qualify and there's a 
potential big leader that you're talking to and says "Hey I got this seat i can't go i but I 
qualified would you like a free trip to South Korea to mastermind with?" And and of 
course you can connect them with me i'll I'll I'll you know have deeper conversations 
with them when I'm there but I'm just saying if you if you qualify figure out someone that 
you can send as a representative um or if you qualify uh uh other people on your team 
also qualifies either make sure they go or they send a representative Let's maximize the 
seats that we have going to this event because each one will come back and be a very 
strong advocate and and and uh ambassador on your team to grow in a way that someone 
who didn't go uh may not be as fired up to to make the kind of uh impact in your team as 
those that do go as we know events change lives and that's why I try to attend as all of 
them even even the ones that might not be for me like in a different language or or not for 
my team but if I can if I can get there I'd love to grow with um those kinds of energies 
and those kind of a caliber of people so with that uh get this done let me know if you 
need any help send me screenshots of wherever you might be stuck send me questions of 
what whatever you might have little confusions on but get this submitted not tomorrow 
today right now uh because you might miss that window and that's going to that's going 
to cost you dearly a completely free uh work vacation to So 

Pop Max | Team Launch Presentation & Live Withdraw 
• selling or you can slide this toggle all the way to the end and it's going to be 2,700 and 
um 58 sell PPT and um if you get this then just that just means you need to do two 
transaction maybe um and then let's go to wallets and spot and see what now my balance 
is in the form of usdt um on in um in in the exchange Now I can go ahead and execute a 
withdraw which um you don't need to do kyc but you do need to do Google Authenticator 
which is a validation app and it will send you your uh code there now if I go to uh grab 
my address from bitet right there uh I will send it there to show you it going back to the 
same wallet um but you could send it to any wallet uh I'm choosing the binance smart 
chain on usdt select all now if you see this zero right here that just means you need to 
give it a few more minutes for the system to up update don't freak out it says 621 there it 
just needs to like update internally but in the meantime let me show you what I was going 
to show you on Telegram in our team Channel where I have a lot of information 
including an interview I did with the venture capitalist uh here are some of the other 
activities that's happening in different parts of Asia meetings and presentations um office 
get togethers uh I was this is the price at 18 cents and now it's already at 20 this was 
when it was at 15 cents lot of activities so this is just new to the um well it just officially 
opened up on January 20th of this year um but it is just making its way into the English-
speaking market and that's where our 13 that's where yeah so lot more to explore here 
know uh you guys can dive in there and see a bunch of content around what's happening 
around the world so let's go back here I'm going to refresh and I'm going to execute the 
withdraw again uh we do that by selecting which crypto you want to with well it's in usdt 
um but which usdt chain you want um right here I'm going to do binance smart chain 
select all now we see the 621 you can put a comment there but that's just for you and then 
over here I'm it's going to ask me to do a um email verification and then a Google 
authentication so I'm going to get the code in my email right now and I'm showing you 
the full process of a live withdrawal live conversion u 
• m so you understand how simple it is and the fact that you can um do this anytime 
yourself whenever you have earnings in the back office now submit and it is on the way 
You can track your status here and uh this one says pending progress uh pending 
processing it's 621 um to this wallet address yeah yeah so a lot more transactions uh 231 
433 2011 198 397 58 80 now if we go to my wallet right here um we see that I have no 
usdt so we're going to see about $600 of usdt come into this wallet from the Mexi 
exchange where I converted the token of the platform PPT sold it for USD on the binance 
smart chain and now bringing it here this is a real ecosystem where you can see exactly 
what's happening to the money and you have we have the freedom if I didn't want to sell 
it at that time I didn't have to I could have held on to it because the potential of this could 
be much higher it's 23 cents someday it might be 30 cents or 40 cents or 50 cents or a 
dollar and so I have the freedom to sell whenever I wish which is uh great um because 
then you can decide for yourself so um once that lands we'll see this balance updating but 
the main summary is that we have a passive opportunity with a really big e system that 
allows us to earn each and every day oh look 621 just landed in the wallet um there you 
go I have now $621 of USD ke that I could do anything I want with that um and it say it's 
literally I just did this in real time on this Zoom so you can see from withdrawal to 
conversion to in my wallet um and and that's how people are earning around the world 

anyway that gives you a good summary of the main bullet points there's big things 
happening in fact on the 28th literally in three days um there's an event happening in 
Vietnam for which I will be going there to it's the first International Event first English 
event um and uh there's going to be many announcements at that uh event that that I'm 
going to record and get to you guys but um this is just getting off the ground thank you 
thank you thank you very much s that was a very wonderful presentation about this 
particular company guys I I think you've heard everything he said the the main thing you 
really need to uh pick from this is this is not just um your regular project 
• ke advantage of it right now you're going to be so amazed at how much you can be able 
to generate in three four five six months from now like do you even understand that with 
this project you don't need to even recruit anybody you don't need to bring anybody you 
just take as little as $100 for 360 days and you are making 1% daily from the stake right 
this is not your regular investment platform for most of us who are into crypto we know 
we we know about liquidity pools this is a normal thing that buybid binance they do I 
have been I have participated in a lot of liquidity pools this particular project do 50 50% 
uh $50 if you if you're going to be registering with $100 you have to divide that by two 
meaning that you need to buy the token the P token which is the native token you need to 
buy that $50 and you buy um usdt $50 so you are actually putting it into the liquidity pool 
so this is not some Forex investment platform that is telling you we're going to pay you 
1.6 we're going to do what I mean everybody knows that trading is nothing guaranteed 
this has nothing to do with trading right this is something that is guaranteed to pay you 
for a very very long time so this these are just some of the points that I wanted to reiterate 
um um sales testimonials sales withdrawals all of this was done life so that you see that 
we're not talking about audio money here because some of you might think that this is 
audio money it's not audio money it's video money so that you can understand I don't 
want to go further than this because we're trying to keep this as short possible but I just 
wanted to make sure that the main points um of the presentation that at least I took from 
the presentation and I really wanted to be emphasized um I did that so um we're going to 
get more of this I'm going to also beg s to do a a video of registration so that we can all 
have that and know how we can be able to get kid into this as quickly as possible and for 
those people who do not have crypto knowledge before you don't have to bother because 
we're going to train you guys we're going to educate everybody on how to get a bybit 
account personally I do not like stress so I'm not going to come and say oh I want to buy 
PPT for you or something I'm 
• m going to teach you how to use buybit you're going to download your buybit wallet for 
those people who don't know anything about crypto before I'm going to do that for free 
for you so that you can be able to own your business yourself you don't need to 
necessarily contact your plan whoever is going to refer you into this you can just quickly 
get on board because this is not something that you want to drag your feet on so with that 
being said thank you so much s for this amazing opportunity I would always say thank 
you because this opportunity is coming at such a time as this and um one thing I can 
assure you is that the Nigerian team we going to explode this it is going to be explosive 
and I'm sure that as I'm talking people are actually listening and they are already 
calculating Nigerians they are very calculative so in another video um we're going to I I 
personally will be able to take you guys through on for those people who are interested 
we didn't just want to make this video about referrals so that people who are not 

interested in referrals think that it's only when you refer because with this platform 
whether you refer you don't refer you will make at least 0.4% depending on the amount 
of days that you are obviously invested into this so this has nothing to do with just 
referring but for those people who um find Joy like me in telling people about um 
platforms that I'm really interested and excited about we're going to share more on how 
the referal system works so we can know how we can collectively um how we can 
collectively um leverage on that because there is so much money actually actually there's 
too much money in the referral program and you cannot believe how much you're going 
to make I've said this before thank you very much s and I'm really grateful for this 
opportunity uh and you guys can start today and test it out and see for yourself uh for as 
little as $100 explore the ecosystem because this is not something that is like a a one trick 
pony or just like a passive um you know trading something it has substance it has depth it 
has utility it has a ecosystem it has a social media side it has even bigger plans in fact one 
of the things that I I talked about with the VC is is kind of their their 
Pop Max | WOW $502 Per Day! 
• you that are looking at this for the first time and were just clicking on it because you saw 
that someone's making $500 a day uh let me introduce you to a hidden gem of an 
opportunity where you can earn 27% a month the minimum to get started is just $100 of 
staking you can earn each and every day of the week without needing to refer anyone you 
can withdraw multiple times a day you get your withdrawal instantly under a minute no 
one needs to approve your withdrawal you get your principal back at the end of the term 
the terms can be as little as 10 days to as much as 360 days and there is a matching check 
referral program which pays you every day that your teammates get paid of course I've 
done full in-depth presentation that you can find on our channel this is very important and 
I want to invite any serious leader to come join me at the second international PopMax 
event this one the first one was in Vietnam you guys saw I went there and and made some 
content here i want to take as many of you guys as possible or any of your teammates to 
this event happening from June 4th to June 7th in not just South Korea but Juju Island 
which is a spectacular place and what I love about these uh PopMax events is it's not just 
conferences and meetings but actually they take you out into the country and show you 
the landscapes and it's just really beautiful experience to see the country as well and 
here's the eligibility uh either you can do some personal directs or uh team volumes 
which is number three but number two is what actually so far like seven different people 
on on on our team have qualified through by just making a $10,000 staking for 180 to 
360 days i think 80% of people as as Magnus said is doing the 360day staking it that 
makes the most amount of sense and al and dollars um but also um this needs to be done 
from April 20th to May 20th so that's the time frame in which any of these requirements 
have to be made and then we have a bunch of this stuff that I covered in so many other 
videos you can review those stuff and the price the price of PBT have you been keeping 
an eye on that that has been incredible uh the latest numbers okay let's just refresh uh 22 
cents 23 cents almost 24 cents when we got in those of us tha 
• of the major bullet points of this you can also find this at our team telegram this is one of 
my favorites as well summarizes a lot uh these are the numbers this is the kind of 
credibility of it being listed on these major exchanges uh this is our YouTube channel um 

which I really like um the the fact that we have so much wonderful content other teams 
are using our content and I'm I'm so proud of that that that they find value in it that 
they're they're sharing it and and using it and I'm grateful to have such a um you know 
ability to to distill the information and make valuable content that gets shared and helps 
other people make money we're all in this together pop family worldwide um I'm grateful 
that that we're all winning together okay so another big thing team volume our team 
volume has crossed over half a million dollars which my goodness did that take effort did 
that but now I'm seeing actually you know what's crazy yesterday it crossed $500,000 
yesterday I think I ended the day with $56,000 today it's $521,000 so an additional 
$15,000 i don't even know where that money came from by the way like in the beginning 
I was like okay I I knew who was making the deposits and I knew was coming now it's 
happening without me knowing where such 10,000 5,000 uh boosts are coming from so 
it's it's it's things are happening things are happening uh let's see what the latest numbers 
are 462 right there um 516 it was it was 4 uh 62 now it's 516 so So like it's it's my 
goodness it's awesome oh another cool thing one of you on our team messaged me saying 
"SPT is on Coinbase perhaps soon it will be available to buy itself." I don't know if it's 
available for trading yet but but but there are some details on it on Coin uh base so that 
was pretty interesting she sent me the screenshots and here they are and there's also the 
link which I'll put in our team telegram as well i want to end with just invitation to this 
get your butt to South Korea by the way they will compensate full flight round ticket 
flight from wherever you are in the world plus hotel stay so other than buying stuff uh 
and and most likely with the hotel say you have uh inclusive breakfast uh but they really 
take care of their people and I really enjoyed that 
• going to Vietnam so I highly recommend getting yourself or some of your teammates to 
this event it will change the trajectory of your experience both on a personal level and on 
an income level with Pop Max i'm extremely honored to present this to you guys and 
hopefully you're seeing it through not just words but numbers in your own back office 
and as a collective and soon we'll see a lot of people buzzing with pop and saying "Oh 
did you hear about POP?" And you're like "I'm already in POP i've been in POP for the 
past several months." Um and so right now a lot of the people and and by the way a great 
strategy that I utilize is I drop in my income like a screenshot of that into a lot of the 
people I know that are in our space into their inbox uh if they're open to taking a look and 
then I follow up like few days later with uh an updated amount so if if you're starting to 
like gain a few dollars every few days in terms of income like right now $500 and $2 
both you can use this like somebody on the team is making $500 a day and I will go back 
to a lot of the people that I messaged where last time I was making $460 something dollar 
that I I had taken a screenshot and put it in their inbox and now when I come back and 
drop the 500 they were like it's growing and then I come back like a week later it's 550 
and then another week at 600 or whatever it'll pay attention so use such a strategy where 
you're updating and dripping the progress of you teammates my results feel free to do that 
as we are growing this together i'm extremely extremely honored and grateful that we are 
starting to get the traction and momentum and that's going to be a gamecher for all of us 
as I say the rising tide raises all ships and we're all rising together here with pop hop into 
our communities on Facebook where every single day we're giving away free PPT uh and 
also in Telegram uh there's different promotions that I'm running to give away PPT as 
well so uh hop in there and do the things that I'm saying for the free PBTs uh like making 

a quick video of what you like most about uh pop your pop experience and send that to 
me on Telegram and uh get yourself 100 PBT so that's running right now so feel free to 
message that video to me in Telegram f 
Pop Max | Weekly Update On Comp Plan/ Nxone/ Partnerships 
• nderstand that this is really good we are together building the future so thank you 
everyone for taking your time this is going to be a recording so we'll put it out 
Pop Social | $40,000,000 With 500,000 Users 
• omething I invite all of you to be a part of our pop ecosystem so that we can build 
something that people will remember for the years to come because enough of being the 
victim of centralized social media It's the time that we realize that what social networks 
can be beyond these limits beyond these gatekeepers beyond these people who are using 
the users as as as the profit makers but not giving us the profit They are using our content 
they're using our data they're using our identity and we are getting nothing So let's let's 
create history together and you all are invited to be a part of the pop ecosystem Yeah And 
I'm really glad to be here once again with all of you sharing you guys what we are doing 
And thank you so much S for for inviting me here and I'll always be very much interested 
to be here No Wow That was uh I know I wrote down some very very important points 
for myself uh because this to me was even more exciting than the comp plan and the 
reward system because it shows a much bigger picture of the ecosystem of what's 
possible here and where we are in the early stages of the new era of um moving into uh 
uh new social media and combining as you said web 3 with Wall street and those kind of 
innovations we have here So um I wanted to cover a few final points of um what it is that 
we have in front of us because we are at the right place at the right time and uh I'm really 
really grateful um to be a part of it I actually didn't know the magnitude of what we had 
in front of us when I joined um in in the beginning stages of uh allowing us to um stake 
uh which is still within its first few uh months um I don't think it's been 90 days even of 
of when that started on January 20th and slowly I have been getting more of the 
understanding and information of how grand this can be just thinking about one piece of 
it landing on the because it's so many different parts from Pop Social to Pop Max to pop 
burst to Pop X uh um and just and a lot more partnerships um to come So when we think 
about the 200 million supply when we think about half of that will be burned through 
burning and every time we make a staking 10% of the PPT we're using is going into a 
black hole wallet that it can never be retrieved from When you t 
Pop Social | Web3 BlockChain Social Media Pays You Daily! 
• s that shows that we are a user driven ecosystem and that how much we prioritize our 
users yeah and this is our road map so we uh we have already um introduced did that is a 
decentralized identity RS verifi verifiable reputation system it is already working it has 
been introduced uh White list is done great testing has already begun in the 2025 quarter 
1 We will be officially launching the actual version of our pop social application and it 
will be listed on app store for iOS users and Google Play for the Android users Then our 

AI generated content functionality will also be integrated multichain asset develop de uh 
deployment will be enabled and in the quarter two we will be uh listing the PPT on 
binance which is a big deal right and then there will be content tokenization and NF issu 
these functions will also be live by the quarter two of 2025 and then there's more to come 
that will be revealed with time and this is our vision for the future over million users are 
expected to join the platform and I hope it will be achieved soon and then we have this 
Revenue Target of 1.5 billion dollar it's like shut and revenue so if you are someone who 
want to be a part of it please join our communities please uh give your feedback to us so 
that we can improve and this is something really serious guys we High time that we the 
creators need to have the control of our data and we are doing that through pop social 
awesome you know I actually learned so much from your presentation because I tend to 
just go into the fact that they've been listed and how we can earn from their ecosystem 
but all of the foundational work that you've shown here uh which goes to show that 
there's a big shift happening in content ownership and and how there's now a new set of 
uh social media platforms that is inv involving the participants involving the content 
creators such as you and I into their revenue streams is what's really changing um the 
industry and so I'm really proud to have something that uh is doing that because we we 
uh are living in the blockchain era we're living in the web 3 space and it's like our social 
media hasn't updated Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok they haven't updated to all of 
the new aspects that the blockchain brings 
TGT Vlog #1: From $3.7M To Starting Over 
• then hopefully uh more of the globe so it all starts from here right now in these uh in the 
sweatpants um of these one-to-one interviews and assembling the right team and the right 
engine for a lot of content creation and spreading of Goodwill and good philosophies 
okay okay so what I'm wanting to do is a daily Vlog of many things from travel to 
business to NGO and so I need a team from him to other people um from pictures 
different angles editing um behind the scenes and all that stuff so welcome to my 
bedroom don't mind the pink pillows uh it's not something I control whatever is clean the 
maids put on this is the unpacking of me arriving uh last night literally like uh midnight 
from the Philippines to check out an investment business opportunity and talk to an old 
friend of mine who's actually the owner of the company right now I'm repacking because 
I need some space some peace uh to to go and concentrate on rebuilding so much but my 
mom and my cousin are here to visit and as much as I love them I need my own space 
and so as opposed to telling them to leave I'm going to a hotel for the night literally like 
two blocks away just so I can concentrate and work optimally foreign foreign foreign 
welcome to my staycation right next door to where I live it's not an impressive room I'm 
not here to flatter you with the five-star glamor uh right now I am in a firestorm of 
thoughts and um internal crisis that I'm having to uh deal with the title of this video is not 
too far-fetched in fact uh I have for the first time my life after 2013 when I dropped out 
of medical school to 2023 when I finally crossed multiple seven figures officially earned 
the title of multi-millionaire was it something that is evading me um multiple millions of 
dollars that I have that I cannot access which was funding my life in terms of multiple six 
or six figures a month to no income at all um I am literally down to let me give you a 
specific number of everything I have right now uh in liquid form 15 150 is what I have in 

hand to rebuild my Empire rebuild myself and it's a beautiful time where I'm having to 
tap into everything that I have built up in terms of my character resilience dedication 
perseverance and all of those characteristics are ne 
• eding to come out right now yes I do know the path to seven figures um but it's it's 
something that I uh you never wanted to restart but when faced with it there's no time to 
lament or grieve although it is not necessarily over with that multiple seven figures I just 
don't have access to it I don't know what's happening with it and I can you know put in 
the effort and time energy down a path that I don't control or begin to build new income 
and that is why I've isolated myself in this staycation to work very very focused with my 
secretary and all the clients and coming back from the Philippines with a means by which 
to begin the Journey of rebuilding and that is what we're going to be working on right 
now foreign world where we do a lot of business via text message and uh you know try to 
get to know the other person across the screen across the ocean of the internet one of the 
things that I've noticed that leaves a deep impression amongst my friends my clients and 
the people that I do business with is the Personal Touch of not just voice note but going 
ahead and making a personal video to them to say hey Chris hey John hey Jamie just 
wanted to let you know this and that and that little extra 30 seconds to a minute Bridges a 
huge gap of who am I doing business with the personalization of these sorts of packets of 
communication becomes a lot more deep and that is what I'm diving into what has 
worked for me these extra going these extra steps and these extra miles tapping into the 
roots of what got me to the multiple seven figures going back to those days of like 100 
plus video messages a day builds the pipeline of tremendous amounts of business with 
friends around the world foreign working on Zoom with my secretary pepper on these 
clients and trying to get the opportunity that I have discovered by going to the Philippines 
out to my International clients around the world that are curious about how to put that 
opportunity to use as I have at that I'm doing my for myself I'm also in the midst of this I 
had a in-person meeting with my female trainer who is also stepping up to become my uh 
kind of uh in person guardian of my space and my peace and and making my life into an 
orderly routine guarding me from distraction 
TGT Vlog #2: Back At Sal Mahal 
• back at the Salmon Hill after a day of a staycation very nearby where I got a chance to 
reconfigure my mental framework and set a new precipice with which to concentrate and 
now I can carry that momentum continuously here at the time whenever I need a reset to 
step out of my environment and then reconfigure come back and hit it hard thank you 
foreign foreign you're doing annotations Angelo yeah I I screwed up on the computer no 
it's okay yeah okay uh I'm just trying to copy and paste the address yeah yeah it's all good 
so it's currently uh 8 45 p.m after what feels like a day and a half of activities especially 
doing leg day but I'm happy to say that while it's a incremental step have made about 
twenty eight hundred dollars within the past 24 hours of getting a new business venture 
the one that I went to the Philippines and had the Deep discussions on uh through my 
Sweat Equity efforts and hopping on these Zoom calls in fact I have another Zoom call in 
15 minutes and not to mention that I have to make a social media post talk to my groups 
handle the inbox talk to the VIP support talk to existing clients it's just a whirlwind of 
things that I barely uh remember to eat let alone sleep so so it is an interesting time in my 

day-to-day activities um in the midst of that trying to also shoot this content for who 
knows what but it is something that I'm wanting to remember and wanting to share about 
how I went from nothing to something to nothing to something and nothing to something 
to now rebuilding in a very uh sustainable way in a way that I truly enjoy it and not feel 
like I'm on shaky grounds and this is the Journey of that I'll catch you tomorrow with 
more wildness of of what it takes behind the scenes this is not the glitz and glamor right 
now I'm exhausted but I'm still like trying to push through trying to take micro naps in 
between these Zoom calls I'm literally on mute right now while helping a client sign up 
for a high ticket service and then uh it's it's a beautiful start you know it's kind of the 
feeling of going to bed extremely exhausted but proud of the day's work it's that and I 
hope to do a series of that and I know that that will lay the bricks of rebuilding my 
Empire I'll catch you tomorrow peace

you'll find the resources around you I am just one person that's trying to share my journey 
of what I am going through and going growing through but in regards to you uh I will 
share the distillation of my knowledge that I absorb through uh daily practices of sitting

as a way of driving those deeper into my brain I will teach them to you uh if you decide 
to take advantage of that you can if not at I'm doing it for my own growth uh you know 

teaching is one of the highest forms of learning which is kind of interesting um that you 
learn through teaching and so uh more than I'm spending time in front of the screen uh of

growth uh reading absorbing uh studying um opening myself up to New Dimensions of

attractive people will say hey how are you doing that hey where did you learn that hey
